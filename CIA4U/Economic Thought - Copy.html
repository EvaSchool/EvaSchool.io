<p>How could anybody think that the tradeable pollution permits at the Kyoto Climate Summit could be seen as progress? How could anybody think that something that is common to us all — clean air — can be turned into something that companies own and that they can trade among each other? It's unbelievable!<br>~ Marilyn Waring, 1998</p>

<p>Who should own water?</p>

<p>Canada has 7% of the world's renewable freshwater and 20% of the world's total freshwater resources. The water you use to shower each morning is some of the water we use, but we also drink it. Water is considered a need, not a want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question of who should own/control water has many perspectives from various stakeholders.&nbsp;<br>As you examine the evidence that follows, please keep track of the different stakeholders and their position, then decide where you stand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do different stakeholders view the privatization and/or sale of water? When you finish, you will define the issue and identify the stakeholders.</p>

<h4><strong>Issue number 2&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p><em>Migrant Workers</em></p>
<p>As you examine the evidence for this issue, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are different governments addressing trends related to labor shortages?</li>
<li>What impact do policies concerning migrant workers have in these countries?</li>
<li>What are the causes and effects? Consider different stakeholders.</li>
<li>What should the government do? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>A "migrant worker" is a person who either migrates within their home country or outside of it to pursue seasonal work. Migrant workers who work outside their home country may also be called foreign workers or expatriates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>The Temporary foreign worker program, or TFWP, is a program of the Government of Canada to allow employers in Canada to hire foreign nationals. When the program started in 1973, most workers brought in were high-skill workers, such as specialist doctors.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/f3FwbxwjUzaNlVPwCH9AS1dkfMzHDmUC8459mRwTRgoQWSZ5PU49noKlVB6txrNaalkueqI3cHACnfHku1LcTuJby4TbfmwR3tXBWflt8Jxr7yS_RgWD6SFqcNEuClgSnJUtwuhZHweJ9BXzAkJS70omcwsv3ozZ=nw" alt="" title="" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The Temporary Foreign Workers program allows businesses to hire workers after they prove that no Canadians are qualified or willing to take the job. This is meant to temporarily fill gaps without affecting the Canadian labor force. However, it is possible to hire a temporary worker through the International Mobility Program.</p>
<p>The International Mobility Program (IMP) lets employers hire temporary workers without a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). In other words, employers do not have to prove there are no Canadians qualified or willing to take the job. Exemptions from the LMIA process are based on "broader economic, cultural or other competitive advantages for Canada."</p>

<p><em><strong>READ THIS ARTICLE:&nbsp;</strong></em><br>A note from Jeffrey Sachs (excerpt from The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time, 2005 pp. 11-12)</p>
<p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); white-space-collapse: preserve;">Over the years I have visited garment factories all over the developing world. I have grown familiar with the cavernous halls where hundreds of young women sit at sewing machines, and men at cutting tables, where the fabrics move along production lines and the familiar labels of GAP, Polo, Yves Saint Laurent, Wal-Mart, J.C. Penny, and others are attached as the clothing reaches the final stages of production. There is nothing glamorous about this work. The women often walk two hours each morning in long quiet files to get to work. Arriving at seven or seven-thirty, they may be in their seats for most of the following twelve hours. They often work with almost no break at all or perhaps a very short lunch break, with little chance to go to the lavatory. Leering bosses lean over them posing a threat of sexual harassment. After a long, difficult, tedious day, the young women trudge back home, when they are again sometimes threatened with physical assault. These sweatshop jobs are the targets of public protest in developed countries; those protests have helped to improve the safety and quality of the working conditions. The rich-world protesters, however, should support increased numbers of such jobs, albeit under safer working conditions, by protesting the trade protectionism in their own countries that keeps out garment exports from countries such as Bangladesh. These young women already have a foothold in the modern economy that is a critical, measurable step up from the villages of Malawi (and more relevant for the women, a measureable step up from the villages of Bangladesh where most of them were born). The sweatshops are the first rung on the ladder out of extreme poverty. They give the lie to the Kissinger State Department’s forecast that Bangladesh is condemned to extreme poverty. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); white-space-collapse: preserve;">On one visit to Bangladesh, I picked up an English-language morning newspaper, where I found an extensive insert of interviews with young women working in the garment sector. These stories were poignant, fascinating, and eye-opening. One by one, they recounted the arduous hours, the lack of labor rights, and the harassment. What was most striking and unexpected about the stories was the repeated affirmation that this work was the greatest opportunity that these women could ever have imagined and that their employment had changed their lives.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); white-space-collapse: preserve;">Nearly all of the women interviewed had grown up in the countryside, extraordinarily poor, illiterate unschooled, and vulnerable to chronic hunger and hardship in a domineering, patriarchal society. Had they (and their forebearers of the 1970s and 1980s) stayed in the villages, they would have been forced into a marriage arranged by their fathers, and by seventeen or eighteen, forced to conceive a child. Their trek to the cities to take jobs has given these young women a chance for personal liberation of unprecedented dimension and opportunity.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); white-space-collapse: preserve;">The Bangladeshi women told how they were able to save some small surplus from their meager pay, manage their own income, have their own rooms, choose when and whom to date and marry, choose to have children when they felt ready, and use their savings to improve their living conditions and especially to go back to school to enhance their literacy and job-market skills. As hard as it is, this life is a step on the way to economic opportunity that was unimaginable in the countryside in generations past.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); white-space-collapse: preserve;">Some rich-country protesters have argued that Dhaka’s apparel firms should either pay far higher wage rates or be closed, but closing such factories as a result of wages forced above worker productivity would be little more than a ticket for these women back to rural misery. For these young women, these factories offer not only opportunities for personal freedom, but also the first rung on the ladder of rising skills and income for themselves and, within a few years, for their children. Virtually every poor country that has developed successfully has gone through these first stages of industrialization. These Bangladeshi women share the experience of many generations of immigrants to New York City’s garment district and a hundred other places where their migration to toil in garment factories was a step on the path to a future of urban affluence in succeeding generations.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: rgb(52, 58, 64); white-space-collapse: preserve;">Not only is the garment sector fueling Bangladesh’s economic growth of more than 5 percent per year in recent years, but it is also raising the consciousness and power of women in a society that was long brazenly biased against women’s chances in life. As part of a more general and dramatic process of change throughout Bangladeshi society, this change and others give Bangladesh the opportunity in the next few years to put itself on a secure path of long-term economic growth. The countryside that these women have left is also changing quickly, in part because of the income remittances and ideas that the young women send back to their rural communities, and in part because of the increased travel and temporary migration between rural and urban areas, as families diversify their economic bases between rural agriculture and urban manufacturers and services.</span></p>
