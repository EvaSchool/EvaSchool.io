<h1>Supply and Demand Curve</h1>
<p class="small"></p>
<blockquote><footer>The supply and demand curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between the quantity of a good or service that producers are willing to supply and the quantity that consumers are willing to purchase at different prices. These curves are essential tools in economics, providing insights into market dynamics and helping us understand how prices are determined.</footer></blockquote>

<div class="card-body">
<h4>1. <strong>Supply Curve:</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- The supply curve is an upward-sloping line on a graph, which shows that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied by producers also increases. In other words, there is a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied. Producers are generally willing to produce and supply more of a good as prices rise because it becomes more profitable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;- The supply curve typically represents the law of supply, which states that all else being equal, an increase in price leads to an increase in the quantity supplied, and a decrease in price leads to a decrease in the quantity supplied.</p>

<h4>2. <strong>Demand Curve:</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- The demand curve, in contrast, is a downward-sloping line on a graph. It shows that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded by consumers decreases. Conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases. This reflects the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp;- The demand curve represents the law of demand, which states that, all else being equal, an increase in price leads to a decrease in the quantity demanded, and a decrease in price leads to an increase in the quantity demanded. This is because consumers tend to buy more of a good when it's cheaper and less when it's more expensive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The point at which the supply and demand curves intersect is known as the <strong>equilibrium</strong>. At this price and quantity, the quantity supplied matches the quantity demanded, resulting in a stable market price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Changes in factors such as consumer preferences, production costs, government policies, or external shocks can shift the supply and demand curves. When these curves shift, the equilibrium price and quantity change, leading to fluctuations in the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The supply and demand curves are powerful tools that help economists and businesses make predictions about market behavior and better understand the dynamics of various industries. By analyzing these curves, we can gain insights into price changes, consumer behavior, and the effects of economic policies on different markets.</p>
