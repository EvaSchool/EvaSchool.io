Watson and<br>Crick combined all of the available information into their double helix model<br>of DNA.<br>• Each nucleotide in the DNA molecule consists of a deoxyribose sugar, a<br>phosphate group, and one of the four nitrogenous bases. The phosphates and<br>sugars are joined together to form the backbone of each strand. The molecule<br>is double stranded and forms a helix. The two strands of the molecule are<br>antiparallel.</p></body></html>
