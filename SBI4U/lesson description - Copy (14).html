<p style="text-align: justify;">Sequencing the Human Genome: The Role of Collaboration and Competition in Science&nbsp;Abstract<br>In 1990, the U.S.-funded, internationally-supported Human Genome Project (HGP)&nbsp;was set up to map the human genome. The HGP team, led by Dr. Francis Collins,&nbsp;used the Sanger chain termination sequencing technique, beginning with a map of&nbsp;genetic landmarks on each chromosome. In 1998, however, their effort was chal&nbsp;linked by a private company, Celera Genomics, led by Dr. Craig Venter. The Celera&nbsp;team proposed to decode the genome using the shotgun technique and intended&nbsp;to complete their work in just three years, four years ahead of the HGP target. This&nbsp;competition inspired the HGP team to accelerate their work. Both teams published&nbsp;their first working drafts of the human genome ahead of schedule, in February 2001.&nbsp;skills&nbsp;handbook A3</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the early 1970s, scientists began to be able to read the base<br>sequences of DNA and RNA. In 1977, Dr. Frederick Sanger&nbsp;and his co-workers developed the most reliable and easiest&nbsp;method at the time, called the chain termination method or&nbsp;the Sanger-dideoxy method (Section 8.2). About 10 years&nbsp;later, an automated sequencer was developed, initiating the&nbsp;idea of sequencing the entire human genome. However,&nbsp;sequencing took a huge amount of time; for example, it took&nbsp;a whole year just to get 1000 letters of genetic code.&nbsp;Sequencing the Human Genome</p>

To&nbsp;quote an HGP team member,&nbsp;...the challenge was to get a complete list of our&nbsp;As, Ts, Cs, and Gs ... so the business of making&nbsp;tests, medicines, and cures could begin.<br>The HGP team used the Sanger method.&nbsp;Frustrated by the slowness of the project, Dr. Craig&nbsp;Venter left his position at the HGP in 1998. He founded his own company, Celera Genomics, with the goal of&nbsp;sequencing the entire genome in only three years. “Celera”&nbsp;comes from the Latin word for “speed.” Venter set a ban&nbsp;on computers running 24 hours a day, every day, and used the shotgun technique that had been developed over the previous 20 years (Section 8.2).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The shotgun technique involved chopping human DNA&nbsp;into tiny pieces, which were copied repeatedly in bacteria&nbsp;and then tagged with colored dyes. New analyzing equipment could read each color one by one (Figure 1). Since&nbsp;each color represented one of the bases of the genetic code, the sequences added up rapidly. After each fragment of DNA was sequenced, the computer added it to&nbsp;a layered pile. The position of each fragment in the pile&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Venter knew that whoever published the complete human&nbsp;genome first would be famous—front-page news, interviews&nbsp;with television journalists and talk-show hosts, just like&nbsp;celebrities. With two teams in the game, the project had&nbsp;become a race.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The publicly funded HGP team was now faced with the&nbsp;prospect of being beaten by a private company. Dr. Eric&nbsp;Lander, a prominent member of the HGP and a professor at&nbsp;the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), called the&nbsp;other leaders of the HGP together. If they wanted to finish the&nbsp;genome before Celera did, they would have to purchase new&nbsp;and unfamiliar equipment and step up their production rate.<br>Competition</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr. Venter showed an entrepreneurial characteristic of science—competition. Helped by his tenacious nature, Venter&nbsp;did not give up on his project when he could not get funding&nbsp;via traditional channels. Instead, he raised his own money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When discussing the HGP later, Dr. Lander acknowledged that even among academic groups there is still a lot&nbsp;of competition to be the first to publish scientific results.&nbsp;Competition pushes people both within and between&nbsp;organizations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a private company, Celera intended to patent the information and sell it to anyone who wanted it. The HGP, on the&nbsp;other hand, intended to publish the genome sequence so that&nbsp;it would be available, free of charge, to scientists around the&nbsp;world. Dr. Lander said later, ...we really felt deeply that these were data that&nbsp;had to be available for everybody. And there&nbsp;was an attempt to claim the public imagination&nbsp;for the proposition that these data were better&nbsp;done in some private fashion and owned.<br>After the HGP geared up with their new equipment&nbsp;and techniques, both teams appeared to be running neck&nbsp;and neck. By June 2000, the HGP and Celera called it a tie.<br>Dr. Collins said,<br>I think both Craig [Venter] and I were really&nbsp;tired of the way in which the representations had&nbsp;played out and wanted to see that sort of put&nbsp;behind us.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was probably not good for Celera&nbsp;as a business to have this image of being sort of&nbsp;always in contention with the public project. It&nbsp;certainly wasn’t good for the public project to be&nbsp;seen as battling with a private-sector enterprise.<br>Both Venter and Lander published their work in February 2001,&nbsp;three years earlier than the HGP originally estimated (Lander&nbsp;et al., 2001; Venter et al., 2001). Since then, the shotgun method&nbsp;of sequencing DNA has become the standard method.<br>The Winner’s Circle&nbsp;In June 2000, Dr. Craig Venter and Dr. Francis Collins were&nbsp;both invited to the White House in Washington, D.C. In&nbsp;the presence of U.S. President Clinton and British Prime&nbsp;Minister Tony Blair, the two shook hands and announced&nbsp;the end of the project. In his speech, President Clinton said,&nbsp;Nearly two centuries ago, in this room, on this&nbsp;floor, Thomas Jefferson ... spread out a magnificent map [of a] courageous expedition across&nbsp;the American frontier all the way to the Pacific.&nbsp;Today the world is joining us here in the East&nbsp;Room to behold a map of even greater significance.</p>
