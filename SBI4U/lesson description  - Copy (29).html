<h2>Human Population:&nbsp;Past &amp; Present</h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>100,000 years ago, → Few thousand People</p>
<p>Current Human Population → 7 billion People</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>How did the human population achieve this astounding growth?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Unlike other species, humans have developed the capacity to expand into habitats and climate zones that were once uninhabited and increase the carrying capacity of the environment.</li>
<li>We have removed or reduced many limiting factors that once regulated population growth.</li>
<li>The ever-growing population is not evenly distributed over the Earth’s surface.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some areas continue to grow and increase in density, while others stabilize or even decline</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For most of human history, the world population grew slowly in response to density-dependent environmental factors:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Availability of food</li>
<li>Availability of water</li>
<li>Shelter</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past two centuries, however, the world population has grown exponentially.&nbsp;Demographers have identified four ways that humans have avoided the effects of density-dependent regulating factors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have expanded our geographic range alleviating &amp;nbsp; competition for space.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Beginning about 11,000 years ago, the carrying capacity of many areas increased due to a shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture.</li>
<li>In the mid-eighteenth century, people learned how to harness the energy in fossil fuels. This marked the beginning of industrialization in Western Europe and North America.</li>
<li>Advances in public health reduced the effects of critical population-limiting factors, such as malnutrition, contagious diseases, and poor hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, people began planting seeds to grow food.&nbsp;However, evidence suggests that the idea of cultivating crops developed slowly over thousands of years.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-body">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advent of agriculture dramatically changed the course of human existence.&nbsp;Many of the same foods that we eat today were among the first to be farmed by our early ancestors.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Rice, a staple of many diets today, was first farmed about 9000 years ago.</li>
<li>Raising livestock also changed human existence.&amp;nbsp;</li>
<li>Livestock provided people who were living in areas that were not good for producing crops (such as rocky or steep ground) with another source of food.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Animals in these areas converted the native inedible plants into food that could be eaten.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Sheep, goats, and pigs were among the first to be raised by humans in Asia, starting around 10,000 years ago.20</li>
<li>Location and indigenous species played a significant role in the development of agricultural practices.</li>
<li>With the domestication of plants and animals, populations were transformed from small mobile groups of hunter-gatherers into societies in permanent villages and towns.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People in these permanent communities were able to modify their natural environment through irrigation and specialized crop cultivation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This led to the development of food storage practices and technologies, which resulted in surplus food production.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Populations with large agricultural food surpluses were&nbsp;able to spread out around the world, taking with them their domesticated animals, plants, and other technological&nbsp;advancements.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For example, European settlers brought many plants and animals, including wheat, barley, horses, cattle, and pigs, to North America.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Not everything that European settlers brought with them was beneficial to the Indigenous peoples.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">China, Southeast Asia, North Africa, and Europe experienced some of the worst epidemics in human history.&nbsp;However, it was in these regions of the world that humans started to develop resistance.</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">When European explorers reached the shores of the Americas, they exposed the Aboriginal peoples to “new” diseases.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Aboriginal peoples had serious diseases that were contracted by the Europeans, but these diseases were not adapted to move through large populations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology of the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century had a profound effect on the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of the times.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The steam engine and later the internal combustion engine provided unrivaled sources of power for industry and agriculture.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Industrial Revolution</strong> was a period of great technological advancement from the 1800s to the 1900s, during which machines were developed.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Meanwhile, advances in chemistry led to the production of countless new compounds, such as synthetic fertilizers, which enabled farmers to produce more food.</li>
<li>The most dramatic and immediate effect on human populations resulted from the significant increase in food supply and the reduction in labor needs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Populations became increasingly urbanized as tractors and trains replaced teams of horses.</li>
<li>Advances in public health improved the chances for survival.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Major breakthroughs included improving sanitation and waste removal, improving the quality of the water supply and expanding access to clean water, researching the causes and understanding the transmission of infectious diseases, and developing antibiotics and vaccines (injections of inactive or dead viruses that create resistance).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-body">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The vaccine </strong>is an injection of a dead or&nbsp;inactivated virus to spur an immune&nbsp;response.&nbsp;Safer workplaces, limits on child labor, and better nutrition also improved public health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the Industrial Revolution, Earth’s population doubled to one billion.&nbsp;It doubled again over the next hundred years.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The advancements in science, technology, and medicine have dramatically increased the life expectancy of the population.</li>
<li>By the middle of the twentieth century, humans appeared to have access to unlimited resources. However, the first disadvantages of all the breakthroughs and discoveries were starting to become apparent.<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These included land erosion from deforestation for housing, the loss of large areas of habitat for agricultural purposes, the drainage of wetlands, the depletion of forests for logging, and the extinction or decline of many species that were overharvested (such as whales, bison, and passenger pigeons).</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In Ontario alone, the Carolinian forests were essentially eliminated to make room for agriculture, the white pine forests were destroyed when the pine trees were harvested for shipbuilding in England, and the beavers were trapped until their populations were greatly reduced (and saved only by a change in fashion in Europe).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Ontario was home to massive passenger pigeon populations, but the pigeons were hunted and their habitat was destroyed, driving them to extinction.</li>

<h4>Canada’s Aboriginal Peoples</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 2006 Census of Canada, 1,172,790 respondents, or about 3.8% of Canada’s population, identified themselves as Aboriginal peoples.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aboriginal peoples</strong> are the descendants of First Nation, Métis, or Inuit people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People may identify themselves as Aboriginal if they are Registered Treaty Indians or members of a band or First Nation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Métis: people with both First Nations and European ancestry.</li>
<li>Inuit: Aboriginal people located north of the tree line in Canada or in the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, or northern Québec and Labrador.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In 2006, the largest Aboriginal populations in Canada were in Ontario and the four western provinces, ranging from 242 495 in Ontario to 141 890 in Saskatchewan.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The provinces and territories with the highest proportion of Aboriginal populations were Nunavut (85.0 %), the Northwest Territories (50.3 %), Yukon (25.1 %), Manitoba (15.5 %), and Saskatchewan (14.9 %).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the 2006 census data, Aboriginal peoples in Canada are increasingly living in urban areas, with only 46 %&nbsp;living in rural areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Aboriginal peoples are very diverse. They speak many different languages, enjoy different cultural practices, and participate in varying forms of government.&amp;nbsp;</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>They have always had a strong relationship with the land and its resources. Instead of the market-based approach to property, Aboriginal people do not view the land as being “owned” by any person.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They believe that they are the custodians of the land for future generations.</li>
<li>These differences were poorly understood by the European settlers who came to Canada in the late eighteenth century.</li>
<li>The settlers initially encouraged and eventually forced Aboriginal peoples to assimilate into the European culture.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Treaties were drawn up by the Government of Canada for the purpose of resettlement, attempting to extinguish the rights of Aboriginal peoples to their land.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Consequently, Aboriginal land use and resource development have been affected.</li>
<li>Recent court decisions have upheld the rights of Aboriginal peoples to their land and its resources, returning their entitlement to the use of natural resources over and above any other groups.</li>
<li>The only exceptions are situations in which the conservation of a natural resource takes priority.</li>
<li>Any other interference in the name of public interest is unacceptable, according to the Supreme Court of Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These legal decisions are providing more opportunities for Aboriginal communities to participate in joint government ventures and resource partnerships in forestry, fisheries, and wildlife boards across Canada.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The demographics of the Aboriginal population in Canada differ greatly from the demographics of the non-Aboriginal population.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The age pyramids in the next slide show that the Aboriginal population has a much different population growth pattern than the non-Aboriginal population.</li>
<li>The Aboriginal pyramid reflects an expanding population.</li>
<li>The broad base indicates a high population of children, a rapid rate of population growth, and a low population of older people.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The non-Aboriginal population pyramid reflects. a much slower growth pattern.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Until very recently, many environmental and resource management decisions have been made without Aboriginal consultation or involvement and, as a result, have often&nbsp;had negative effects on the health and well-being of Aboriginal communities.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The difference in the age pyramids in the previous slide indicates that the Aboriginal population will be increasing over the next few decades, possibly leading to increased Aboriginal&nbsp;involvement in these types of decisions.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The relationship between population growth and economic development has been studied extensively.&nbsp;The conventional view is that population growth means more people competing for limited natural and economic resources.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The consequences include more individuals to be cared for, lower per capita income, and generally a lower standard of living compared with countries that have a lower birth rate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The relationship between a country’s population growth and its economic development may follow the trends depicted by the demographic transition model.</li>

<h2>Demographic transition</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The demographic transition </strong>model is a diagram that illustrates changes in how people live to explain shifts in population sizes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The model in the next slide describes historical changes in demographic patterns in the industrialized countries of&nbsp;Western Europe.&nbsp; However, we do not know if it accurately predicts the&nbsp;future of developing nations.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">According to this model, during a country’s pre-industrial stage, birth and death rates are high, and the population grows slowly.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Industrialization begins a transitional, stage when food production rises and health care and sanitation improve</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Improvements in public health reduce the death rate, causing the population to grow rapidly.&nbsp; Then, however, the cost of supporting larger families discourages parents from having as many children.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The birth rate declines, causing a drop in the rate&nbsp;of population growth.&nbsp;Today, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, Russia, and most of Western Europe are in the industrial stage.&nbsp; Their growth rates are slowly decreasing.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, and other European countries, birth rates are lower than death rates.&nbsp;Populations are shrinking, indicating entry into the post-industrial stage.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Kenya and other less industrialized countries are in the transitional stage, but they may not have enough skilled workers or enough capital to make the transition to the industrial stage. As a result, many poorer nations may stay in the transitional stage.</li>

<h4>Planned Reproduction</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most governments realize that increased population size is now a major factor that causes resource depletion, excessive pollution, and an overall decline in quality of life.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>The principles of population ecology demonstrate that, to shrink population size, the rate of population growth must be slowed by decreasing the birth rate or increasing the death rate.</li>
<li>Increasing mortality is neither a rational nor humane means of population control.</li>
<li>Some governments encourage reproductive alternatives in an attempt to lower the birth rate. In several countries, however, this is unlawful.</li>
<li>To achieve ZPG, the average replacement rate (the rate at which parents have children to “replace” them) should be just slightly higher than two children per couple.&nbsp; Replacement rate is the rate at which people have children to “replace” them when they die.</li>
<li>This is necessary because some female children die before reaching reproductive age or do not have children.&nbsp;Today’s replacement rate averages about 2.5 children in less&nbsp;industrialized countries and 2.1 children in more industrialized countries.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, even if each couple on Earth produced only two children, the human population would continue to grow for at least another 60 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Continued population growth is inevitable because today’s children, who outnumber adults, will soon mature and reproduce.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-body">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The worldwide population will stabilize only when the age&nbsp;distributions for all countries resemble the age distributions for countries with ZPG.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Reproductive alternatives can be as simple as a woman waiting to have her first child.&nbsp; This delay will reduce the average family size and slow population growth by increasing generation time.</li>
<li>Two populations in which each woman produces two offspring can be imagined.&nbsp; In the first population, women begin reproducing at 32 years of age.&nbsp;In the second, women begin reproducing at 16 years of age.</li>
<li>After 32 years, women in the first population will be giving birth to their first offspring, but women in the second population will be new grandmothers (assuming that their daughters also bear their first children at 16 years of age).</li>
<li>After 64 years, women in the first population will be new grandmothers, but women in the second population will witness the birth of their first great-great-grandchildren.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, the first population will grow much more slowly than the second.</p>
