  <title>SBI4U – First Day Welcome</title>

  <h2>SBI4U, Biology, Grade 12 University Preparation</h2>

  <h3>Welcome to SBI4U!</h3>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>SBI4U</strong>! This course will help you develop a deeper understanding of the concepts and processes that occur in living systems. You will explore biological structures and functions at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels, and examine the interrelationships between organisms and their environments. This course is designed to prepare you for postsecondary studies in the life sciences, health sciences, or related fields.</p>
  <p>
    In this course, you will study biochemistry, metabolic processes, molecular genetics, homeostasis, and population dynamics. You will also conduct laboratory investigations, research current biological issues, and analyze scientific data to develop and communicate evidence-based conclusions.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Biology, Grade 11, University Preparation (SBI3U).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    SBI4U will challenge you to think critically about complex biological systems and the applications of biological knowledge in modern society. Through practical experiments, projects, and independent research, you will strengthen your skills in scientific investigation, data analysis, and communication.
  </p>
  <p>
    To succeed in this course, stay organized, complete assignments on time, and actively participate in discussions and lab activities. Biology is a cumulative subject—maintaining consistent study habits will help you master the material.
