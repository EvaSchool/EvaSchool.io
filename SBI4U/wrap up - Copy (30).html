<p>In the visual system, photoreceptors detect light stimuli at particular&nbsp;wavelengths. They convert the stimuli to nerve impulses, which move the&nbsp;information via the optic nerve to visual centers in the CNS.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Hair cells in each ear sense sound and respond by triggering action potentials, sending signals via the auditory nerve to the thalamus and then to the brain’s temporal lobe.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chemoreceptors for taste have receptors in taste buds that relay signals to the thalamus and then to gustatory (taste) centers, such as those in the cerebral cortex. Chemoreceptors for smell make direct connections with interneurons.in the brain, rather than using afferent neurons as a conduit.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mechanoreceptors for touch and pressure are embedded in the skin and other surface tissues. They use changes in ion flow across their plasma membrane to generate action potentials in afferent neurons. These action potentials carry signals to the CNS.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Other sensory abilities are involved in homeostasis, such as the ability to sense thermal energy, gravity, acceleration, internal pH, O2, CO2, salts, and glucose.<br>Some sensory systems become less reactive to a stimulus if it continues at a constant level. This reduction is called sensory adaptation.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">When the body is subjected to potentially damaging internal and external conditions, nociceptors (pain receptors) detect these damaging stimuli and send a message to the brain that is interpreted as pain.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A sensory processing disorder (SPD) is a neurological disorder that causes difficulties in processing information received from sensory receptors. Stimuli are received normally but are perceived or interpreted abnormally. Stress is the body’s response to stimuli, or stressors, that cause a disruption in homeostasis. The response is an attempt to restore homeostasis.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Stress can be caused by a range of factors, from waiting for exam results to meeting someone new to starting a new school. Physical stress, such as exercising, can also cause a stress response. Different individuals may respond differently to the same stress.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Symptoms of stress can include accelerated heart rate, sweaty hands, an upset stomach, and rapid breathing.<br>&nbsp;Long-term exposure to stress has been associated with many diseases and negative health effects.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The endocrine, nervous, and excretory systems are all involved in the stress response. The endocrine system secretes hormones, such as epinephrine and cortisol.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The nervous system responds to brief stressors and also stimulates the endocrine system. The excretory system regulates the volume of fluid in the body and maintains or increases blood pressure during an emergency.</li>
