<p style="text-align: justify;">What is it about the chemical makeup of gasoline and glucose that provides the energy needed to run a car or a cell? The one thing that glucose and gasoline have in common that makes them both good fuel molecules is an abundance of hydrogen in the form of carbon-hydrogen (C ] H) bonds (Figure 1). As a result of their structure and bond type, there is a great deal of potential energy in both glucose and gasoline.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Electrons in C ] H bonds are a good source of energy because of their position and proximity to the relatively small atomic nuclei of carbon and hydrogen atoms. For any atom, an electron that is farther away from the nucleus contains more potential energy than an electron that is more closely held by the nucleus (Figure 2).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to distance from the nucleus, the size of the nucleus influences the potential energy of an electron. An electron is more strongly attracted to a large nucleus than to a small nucleus. Therefore, at the same distance away, an electron has more potential energy relative to a large nucleus than relative to a smaller nucleus. As a result, an electron releases energy if it moves closer to a large nucleus and must gain energy to be pulled away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The electrons associated with a C]H bond are approximately equidistant from two relatively small nuclei. As a result, the electrons in C]H bonds contain high energy. This is because they can be readily pulled closer to larger and more attractive nuclei—a process that releases energy. In contrast, molecules that already have an abundance of oxygen contain less potential energy because many of their bonding electrons are close to oxygen, which is strongly electronegative.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The more electronegative an atom is, the greater the force of attraction it has to an additional electron (or electrons). In the case of an oxygen atom, two additional electrons from the atoms of other elements are able to get very close to the oxygen nucleus and are held very strongly. As the electrons in other atoms are attracted to the oxygen nucleus, they lose potential energy—releasing this energy during bond formation. After the additional electrons are in a position close to the oxygen nucleus, the equivalent amount of energy would be required to remove them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These fundamental principles of chemistry are relevant to everyday life. For example, they explain why fat contains more potential energy per unit of weight compared to proteins and carbohydrates. A fat molecule consists almost entirely of C]H bonds. Foods with a high-fat content that are known to be high in energy include fatty fish (tuna or salmon), eggs, avocados, nuts, and meats. When cooking a high-energy food such as bacon, liquefied fat drains from the meat. This fat is highly flammable because of its high energy content, and it can cause a grease fire in your kitchen.</p>

<h4><strong>Energy Changes during Oxidation</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oxidation occurs when an atom or molecule loses electrons to another atom. The term “oxidation” comes from the fact that in many chemical reactions, the electrons within molecules, particularly those referred to as fuels, become bonded to an oxygen atom. Since O2 has very high electronegativity, it is an ideal electron acceptor atom in the process of cellular respiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The opposite of oxidation—known as reduction— occurs when an atom or molecule gains electrons. In a chemical reaction, the atom or molecule that gains electrons is called the oxidizing agent (that is, it oxidizes the other substance). The substance that loses electrons is known as the reducing agent (that is, it reduces the other substance).</p>

<h4><strong>Energy Changes during Oxidation</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you learned in Chapter 1, in some redox reactions, electrons transfer completely from one molecule to another, while in other redox reactions, electrons remain shared between two atoms. The reaction between methane and oxygen illustrates a redox reaction in which the degree of electron sharing changes (Figure 3). Methane and oxygen are the reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are the products.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In methane, the electrons are shared equally between bonded C] H atoms because C and H have almost the same electronegativity. Consider what happens to the electrons with respect to the carbon atoms. In the product CO2, the electrons are drawn closer to the O atoms than to the C atoms because the O atoms are much more electronegative than the C atoms. Overall, this bond configuration means that C has partially lost its shared electrons in the reaction. The carbon atom within methane has been oxidized in this reaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now look at the reactant oxygen and the product water. In the oxygen molecule, the two oxygen atoms share their electrons equally. The O2 reacts with a hydrogen atom from methane. In the water molecule that is produced, the electrons are closer to the O atom than to the H atoms, due to the O atom’s greater electronegativity. Therefore, the oxygen molecule has been reduced. The reaction releases a lot of energy because of the redox reaction that takes place between methane and oxygen. Energy is released when the electrons associated with the C-H bonds in methane move closer to the electronegative oxygen atoms that form CO2 and H2O.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The oxidation of fuel molecules, such as those in food, releases some of the potential energy stored within the molecule and allows it to be used for cellular processes. Redox reactions often involve the movement of electrons associated with hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Therefore, by convention, the removal of hydrogen atoms from, or the addition of oxygen atoms to, a molecule or atom is also called oxidation. Conversely, the addition of hydrogen or the removal of oxygen is called a reduction. The following redox reaction describes the complete oxidation of glucose:</p>

In contrast, the oxygen atoms that were in the form of O2 have now formed bonds with hydrogen and carbon—these oxygen atoms have been reduced. Energy is released from the glucose molecule as the high-energy carbon, and hydrogen electrons transfer to carbon dioxide and water, forming bonds with oxygen.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Rapid Combustion and Controlled Oxidation</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recall that during rapid oxidation, or the burning of fuels such as gasoline, it is oxygen gas itself that does the oxidizing. Glucose molecules can also undergo combustion and burn (Figure 4a). Like all combustion reactions, the oxidation of glucose results in the transfer of electrons to O2. The reaction produces CO2 and H2O and releases energy. CO2 and H2O are produced during the complete oxidation of all organic molecules. Since CO2 and H2O are both fully oxidized, they contain no more available chemical energy. When glucose burns, a large amount of waste thermal energy is released after an initial large energy of activation is overcome by a spark or flame.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An alternative to using rapid oxidation is to use the same overall reaction, resulting in similar end products, but with a series of steps. This is what happens inside cells, where the energy contained in food molecules is released through controlled oxidation. During controlled oxidation, cells are able to capture more free energy and produce less waste thermal energy. The energy contained in all the electrons in the C-H bonds is not liberated suddenly to produce a lot of thermal energy. In cells, the oxidation of glucose occurs through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Figure 4b). Each step in these reactions releases a modest amount of energy following the absorption of a small amount of activation energy, which is provided by the thermal energy of the surroundings. The energy released transfers to energy-carrying molecules for the next step.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thermodynamically, the net energy changes that occur in rapid combustion and controlled oxidation are identical. They are both exergonic reactions that have the same overall change in free energy. The difference is that, in the rapid combustion reaction, all of the energy is given off at once and cannot be as efficiently harnessed to drive metabolic reactions in the cell.</p>

<h2><strong>Energy Carriers</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most important redox reactions in eukaryotic cells occur when glucose is oxidized by oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water. The oxidation of food molecules often uses enzymes called dehydrogenases, which facilitate the transfer of high-energy electrons from food to molecules that act as energy carriers or shuttles. The most common energy carrier molecule in cells is a positively charged coenzyme called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) (Figure 5). At various points during cellular respiration, dehydrogenases remove two hydrogen atoms from a substrate molecule, transferring the two high-energy electrons and only one of the protons (H+) to NAD+. The other H+ is released into the cytosol. This process results in the full reduction of NADH. The efficiency of the transfer of energy between food molecules and NAD+ is high, and very little energy is lost as waste thermal energy. As you will see later, the potential energy carried in NADH and other reduced molecules facilitates the synthesis of ATP. The next chapter examines these processes and related chemical pathways in more detail.</p>
