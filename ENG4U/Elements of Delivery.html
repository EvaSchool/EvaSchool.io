<li style="text-align: justify;">Speaking in front of people causes more anxiety than any other task (more so than reading, writing, or listening.) Many people say how nervous they become when they have to speak – breath shortens, heart rate soars, palms sweat... you may have had a similar experience!</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">As nerve-racking as it can be, public speaking is an important skill to have, and it is something that often can't be avoided (much as we would like to.)&nbsp;<br>

<li style="text-align: justify;">The planning, preparation, writing, and research go on beforehand.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Then, there is the delivery of the content – the diction, body language, phrasing, and tone that we will call the elements of delivery.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">These elements can be evaluated only within the context or purpose for which the speaker is saying anything at all.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The measures by which we analyze the effectiveness of a political speech are different from those of an academic presentation or a speech that is meant to entertain.</li>

<h2>Elements of Delivery</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How you deliver your presentation is just as important as what you say and how you have organized your talk.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Audiences, whether consciously or not, believe that nonverbal impressions are more reliable indicators of whether a speaker is honest, knowledgeable, and trustworthy.</p>

<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Before you utter your first phrase, your presence in the room is speaking volumes to your audience.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Your stance can tell your audience if you are nervous, confident, or uncomfortable. What do you want to portray?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A balanced stance with the weight equally distributed on both feet and leaning slightly onto the toes shows the audience that you are engaged with them and that you are balanced and present.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you slump to one side, leaning into one foot and popping the opposite hip out, such movement can unwittingly convey that you don't really care about where you are.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Strategies: Posture</h2>

<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Upright posture conveys confidence.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">At the best of times, most of us could use a little postural adjustment.&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
<li>Try this exercise:&nbsp;<br>Stand tall, with your feet pointing directly ahead and not quite shoulder-width apart. Your arms should fall relaxed to your side. As you breathe in, feel your lungs fill and your chest rise, carrying with it your shoulders. Keep this lift in the shoulders, and gently roll the shoulders back. On your exhale, keep this shoulder position while you release any tension. Breathe slowly and deeply, pay attention to any tension you feel, and try to release it. Tuck your tailbone slightly towards the floor, and find a head position that feels balanced directly over the neck. Do this in front of a mirror if you like. You are standing naturally, even though it may not be what you are used to.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Remind yourself now and again in your everyday life to find this neutral stance, and eventually, it may become more automatic.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Strategies: Movement</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Some movement during a presentation adds interest, but overly predictable or exaggerated movement will detract from your performance.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Move slowly, and use the stage effectively when emphasizing points.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Keep the movement simple, face the audience, and maintain a reasonable distance from your audience so you don’t intrude on their space.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Hand gestures can punctuate, illustrate, or show the importance of statements.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Free up your hands by not using cue cards, keep them out of your pockets and out of your hair.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Strategies: Hand Gestures</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The hands are powerful tools! They can punctuate, illustrate, and gesture on a beat to show the importance of your profound statements. Using your hands can vastly improve the effectiveness of your speech.&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
<li>So, this is another good reason not to tie them up with cue cards, or hide them in your pockets, or otherwise occupy them with nervous habits like twirling your hair</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Use your shoulders.&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
<li>In a larger room, it is more effective to initiate the gesture from the shoulder, as it makes the gesture bigger, and more visible to your audience. Using more of your body also helps to make you look more animated and energetic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Gesture on key points.&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Gesture to punctuate key points. Don't feel the need to gesture continuously, for this can be distracting and doesn't help you or your audience highlight key information.</li>

<li style="text-align: justify;">Facial gestures are important, so smile, frown, raise your eyebrows, or use other expressions to make our presentation more involving for the audience.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Remember to make eye contact, and avoid reading prepared material.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Address your comments to individuals in the audience, but keep the eye contact brief and varied in order to be inclusive.</li>

<li style="text-align: justify;">Connecting words in speech is a natural tendency for people who are familiar with the language.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">ESL students, however, have difficulty understanding informal terms such as “wanna,” so if you use such expressions, you may run the risk of causing your audience to misunderstand your speech.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Record your speech, listen for expressions that may confuse your listeners, and practice saying those terms before you make your final copy.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In some cases, simply slowing down can result in a clearer delivery.</li>

<li>Sounds like <strong>d, t, b, p, k,</strong> and <strong>g</strong> are plosives which are suddenly released in speech. These sounds may occur anywhere within words, but those in the middle are often dropped by speakers.</li>
<li>Or you may try mimicking speakers who have good enunciation already.<br>
<ul>
<li>Professional broadcasters, for example, model good speaking habits.&nbsp;</li>

<li style="text-align: justify;">They include <strong>cadence and rhythm, volume, and inflection.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The effective use of these strategies helps your audience connect with you, increases the rate of comprehension, and generally makes your speech more enjoyable and interesting.</li>

<div class="tab-pane fade">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Cadence and rhythm refer to the rhythmic flow of words. Having a good rhythm and using rhythm changes to emphasize key points are two of the most powerful tools you have at your disposal in the creation of an effective speech.</li>

<li style="text-align: justify;">As speaking guru Patti Wood points out, one of the things that makes Obama's speeches so captivating is his play with changing rhythm, which includes the use of pauses.&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">He starts slowly, increases his pace, builds excitement, and then pauses to allow the audience to absorb his ideas. He speaks rhythmically and gestures on the stronger beats in his speech patterns as well.</li>

<li style="text-align: justify;">This young woman provided an example of a less-than-effective presentation. Her content was certainly valuable, but her style was lacking, sadly. Now, let's analyze her delivery. What were the weaknesses?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Appropriateness: </strong>While this presentation looks as if it were given in a classroom, which is usually an informal setting, the speaker will have a better chance of gaining her audience’s attention when she no longer has sunglasses (who needs them indoors?), dresses more formally than her hoodie indicates, and removes the scarf.&nbsp;<br>This speaker makes herself unavailable in almost every way because she has not done adequate preparation. Because she needs her notes, she is largely concealed by the rostrum. This physical barrier between the speaker and the audience also limits the attention the audience will pay to the delivery.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Body Language: </strong>Her body language suggested that she was both nervous and bored. Her eyes were down, her head was propped in her hand, and she fidgeted often. Part of the body language problem stemmed from the fact that she was poorly prepared and read from her book the entire time. She seldom looked at the audience, and this signaled her lack of confidence.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vocal Strategies: </strong>She spoke too quickly and seemed as if she simply wanted the presentation to end. In the course of the speech, her initial enthusiasm faded as her pace increased.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Constructive Feedback:</strong> This speaker should do away with the book and use notes if she requires such cues. She should also develop eye contact with her viewers so the audience can connect emotionally with her.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Analysis of Video 2: Cholesterol</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">This is a mediocre presentation, one which could stand improvement.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Appropriateness: </b>The attire of the presenter is appropriate, as is the setting, which contains examples of foods that contain cholesterol. She takes care to define her terms in order to make herself clear to her adult audience. Her terms, such as saturated fats and the different types of cholesterol, appeal to an audience of both men and women who have likely done some reading on the matter and are health-conscious. This presentation would be useful for parents who are concerned about their children’s health.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Body Language: </strong>Her body language is stiff and awkward, and she does not make use of gestures. While she does maintain eye contact for the most part, looking to the side is distracting for the audience. In a taped presentation, the speaker should try to make comments in the direction of the camera.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vocal Strategies: </strong>Her enunciation is good, but she hesitates and does not maintain a natural syntax. Because her pauses are not naturally occurring, her cadence and rhythm are less than effective.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Constructive Feedback: </strong>This speech appears to be memorized, and for that reason when she fears forgetting parts of her speech, she loses momentum. This results in a less natural delivery, one that is no longer conversational.</p>
