<p><strong>Optimization in Economics</strong></p>
<p>Optimization techniques are used throughout industry, since the goal is to maximize profits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A company’s profit is the amount left over after the costs of production have been discounted from the company’s total income (called revenue).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, profit is the difference between revenues and costs, If the profit is represented by p(x), revenues by r(x) and costs by c(x), then &nbsp; &nbsp;p(x) = r(x) - c(x)</p>
<p>The cost of manufacturing fishing poles can be modelled by the function c(x) = 7x - 3, where x is the number of batches (each containing 1000 poles) manufactured. Revenue is modelled by r(x) = x3 - 10x2 + 20x. A small company has enough workers to produce a maximum of 1200 fishing poles. Find the number of fishing poles that the company should manufacture to maximize profits.</p>
