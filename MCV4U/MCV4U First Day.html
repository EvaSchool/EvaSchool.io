  <!-- 课程信息标题 -->
  <h2>MCV4U, Calculus and Vectors</h2>

  <!-- 简要介绍 -->
  <p><strong>Welcome to MCV4U!</strong></p>
  <p>
    This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of differential calculus and vector analysis. Students will develop an understanding of the rate of change, derivative rules, and their geometric and real-world applications. Additionally, students will explore vectors in two and three dimensions and solve problems involving vector quantities and planes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The skills developed in this course are foundational for many post-secondary programs in mathematics, science, engineering, and economics. The course builds on prior knowledge of functions and extends students’ problem-solving and logical reasoning abilities.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> MHF4U (Advanced Functions), as specified by the Ontario Ministry of Education</p>

  <!-- 课程理念 -->
  <p>
    This course was created with a focus on <strong>deep thinking over memorization</strong>. Calculus and vectors are grounded in logic, geometric interpretation, and abstract reasoning. Understanding the “why” behind each concept is crucial to your success.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are encouraged to work through problems thoughtfully and creatively. As you engage with the material, ask questions, explore patterns, and reflect on strategies. Be open to feedback, and approach challenges as opportunities to grow.
  </p>
