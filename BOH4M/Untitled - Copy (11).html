<h2><strong>Promoting Ethical Behavior</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>These persons in different work settings and linked to various issues share two important things in common.&nbsp;</li>
<li>First, each was a whistleblower. They exposed the misdeeds of others in their organizations in order to preserve ethical standards and protect against further wasteful, harmful, or illegal acts. Second, they were all fired from their jobs.</li>
<li>At the same time that we can admire whistleblowers for their intent and ethical stances, there is no doubt that they face risks in taking such actions. Research by the Ethics Resource Center has found that some 44 percent of workers in the United States fail to report the wrong- doings they observe at work.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The top reasons for not reporting are: “(1) the belief that no corrective action would be taken and (2) the fear that reports would not be kept confidential.”</li>
<li>Whistleblowers are known to suffer impaired career progress and other forms of organizational retaliation, up to and including termination.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Although laws in the United States such as the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 offer whistleblowers some defence against “retaliatory discharge,” legal protections are continually being tested in court, and many consider them inadequate at best. American laws vary from state to state, and federal laws mainly protect government workers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In Canada, specific whistleblower protection is only found in New Brunswick and Saskatchewan. Otherwise, Canadians may have vague coverage under the Public Servants Disclosure Act of Bill C-11</li>

</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Ethics training takes the form of structured programs to help participants understand the ethical aspects of decision-making. It is designed to help people incorporate high ethical standards into their daily behaviors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are lots of options in ethics training. Canadian university and college curricula include coursework on ethics, and seminars on the topic are popular in the corporate world.&nbsp;<br>But regardless of where or how the ethics training is conducted, it is important to keep things in perspective.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="card-title"><strong>&nbsp;Promoting Ethical Behavior - Codes of Ethical Conduct</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Ethics training often includes the communication of a code of ethics, and a formal statement of an organization’s values and ethical principles. Such codes are important anchor points in professions such as engineering, medicine, law, and public accounting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In organizations, they identify expected behaviors in such areas as general citizenship, the avoidance of illegal or improper acts in one’s work, and good relationships with customers. Specific guidelines are often set for bribes and kickbacks, political contributions, honesty of books or records, customer-supplier relationships, co-worker relationships, and confidentiality of corporate information.</p>

<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Promoting Ethical Behavior - Ethical Role Models</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>Top managers, in large and small enterprises, have the power to shape an organization’s policies and set its moral tone by serving as ethical role models. The day-to-day behavior of those at the top should be the epitome of high ethical conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their words and actions should be consistent in communicating ethics expectations throughout the organization. But even though top managers bear a special responsibility for setting the ethical tone of an organization, all managers should act as ethics role models, and both expect and support ethical behavior by others.&nbsp;</p>
