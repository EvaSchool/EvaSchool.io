<h4><strong>Discussion</strong></h4>
<p>Why do you think an organization must adapt to change?</p>
<p>We live in a new workplace ripe with challenges, opportunities, and uncertainty. That's why organizations must adapt to change quickly.</p>

<h4><strong>Changing Workplace Dynamics</strong></h4>
<p>The workplace is constantly changing for several reasons, including factors such as intellectual capital, globalization, technology, diversity, ethics, and careers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-body">
<h4><strong>Intellectual Capital</strong></h4>
<p>Intellectual Capital is the collective brainpower or shared knowledge of a workforce. What people know and learn, and what they do with this knowledge is the foundation of organizational performance. A knowledge worker is someone whose mind is a critical asset to employers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-body">
<h4><strong>Globalization</strong></h4>
<p>Globalization is the worldwide interdependence of resources, products, and business competition. It is described as a process in which "improvements in technology" combined with the deregulation of markets and open borders bring about vastly expanded flows of people, money, goods, services, and information.</p>
<p>In a globalized world, countries and people are increasingly interconnected through news, travel, lifestyles, etc. When more Canadians discover that their customer service call is answered in India, their company's website is designed in Malaysia, and their tax return is prepared by an accountant in the Philippines, it is clear that globalization provides both opportunities and challenges.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-body">
<h4><strong>Technology</strong></h4>
<p>In many ways, the forces of globalization ride on the foundations of the Internet and a continuing explosion in communication technologies.</p>
<p>For better or worse, we live and work in a technology-driven world increasingly dominated by bar codes, automatic tellers, email, instant messaging, text messaging, blogs, online media, electronic commerce, social networks, and more.</p>
<p>Physical distance hardly matters anymore.</p>
<p>Agree or Disagree?<br>In "virtual space," people hold meetings, access common databases, share information and files, make plans, and solve problems together - all without ever meeting face to face. The new technologies have also added great flexibility to work arrangements, allowing people to telecommute, work from home, and maintain mobile offices while working in non-traditional ways and free from the constraints of 9 to 5 schedules.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-body">
<h4><strong>Diversity</strong></h4>
<p>The term workforce diversity describes the composition of a workforce in terms of differences among people according to gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and able-bodiedness.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada predicts that by 2031, three in 10 Canadians (between 29 and 32 percent) will be members of visible minority groups. South Asians and Chinese compose the largest portion of the visible minority, while Arabs and West Asians are predicted to be the fastest-growing minority groups in Canada between 2006 and 2031.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card col-12">
<div class="card-body">
<h4><strong>Ethics</strong></h4>
<p>The issue raised here is ethics - a code of moral principles that sets standards of what is "good" and "right" as opposed to "bad" and "wrong" in the conduct of a person or group. And even though ethical failures like those at Enron are well publicized and should be studied, there are many positive cases and ethical role models to be studied as well.</p>
