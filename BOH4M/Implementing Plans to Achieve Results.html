<p style="text-align: justify;">Although most of us are aware of the importance of goal setting in management, the tendency may be to mistakenly think it’s an easy thing to accomplish. The reality is that the ways goals are set can make a big difference in how well they do in pointing people in the right direction and inspiring them to work hard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great goals tend to have these five characteristics:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Great goals are SMART:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Specific</strong> - They clearly target key results and outcomes to be accomplished.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Measurable</strong> - They are worded so that results can be clearly measured.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Attainable</strong> - They are challenging, including a stretch factor that moves toward real gains, yet they are realistic and possible to achieve.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Referred to / Relevant</strong> - They are referred to regularly to keep people focused on the task at hand.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Timely / Time-bound</strong> - They are linked to specific timetables and&nbsp;due.</p>

<h2 class="card-title"><strong>Goal Alignment</strong></h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>It is one thing to set good goals and make them part of a plan. It is quite another to make sure that goals and plans are well integrated across the many people, work units, and levels of an organization as a whole.</p>
<p>Goals set anywhere in the organization should ideally help advance its overall mission or purpose. Yet, we sometimes work very hard to accomplish things that simply don’t make much of a difference in organizational performance.</p>
<p>This is why goal alignment is an important part of managerial planning.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Figure below shows how a hierarchy of goals or hierarchy of objectives helps with goal alignment. When a hierarchy of objectives is well defined, the accomplishment of lower-level objectives is the means to the accomplishment of higher-level ones.</p>
<p>The example in the figure below is built around quality goals in a manufacturing setting. Strategic goals set by top management cascade down the organization step by step to become quality management objectives for lower levels. Ideally, everything works together in a consistent “means-end” fashion so that the organization becomes “the number one supplier of recyclable food containers.”</p>

<p>Planning is a process, not an event, and “participation” is one of its keywords. The best planning in organizations probably begins at the top of the organization or work unit and then proceeds in a participatory fashion to actively involve others from lower levels.</p>
<p>Participatory planning includes, in all planning steps, the people who will be affected by the plans and asked to help implement them.</p>
<p>This role of participation and involvement in the planning process is shown in the figure on the right. There are many benefits when and if it can be followed in practice.</p>

<p>Participation can increase the creativity and information available for planning. It can also increase the understanding and acceptance of plans, as well as commitment to their success.</p>
<p>And even though participatory planning takes more time, it can improve results by improving implementation.</p>

<div class="card-body">
<p>An example of the benefits of a participatory approach to planning is found at Boeing. Former CEO Alan Mulally faced indecision in the firm’s management ranks after the attacks on September 11, 2001, left the airline industry in turmoil and new plane orders plummeted.</p>
<p>To regain momentum, he instituted a new planning approach that started with strategy sessions on Thursdays with 30 top executives. His message was to look ahead to the time when the slump in airplane orders would be over and plan now for a new generation of planes.</p>
