<p>Here are a few Canadians among the many examples you can find of people who have made the commitment to create and work for organizations that follow ethical and socially responsible practices.</p>
<p>David Suzuki’s commitment to educating and promoting environmental sustainability led him to start the David Suzuki Foundation in 1990 (Figure 14.6).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the foundation focuses on “working with government, business and individuals to conserve our environment by providing science-based education, advocacy and policy work, and acting as a catalyst for the social change that today’s situation demands.”</p>

<li>In management, we use the term corporate social responsibility or CSR to describe an organization’s obligation to act in ways that serve both its own interests and the interests of society at large.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Some discuss this commitment to social responsibility in respect to a double bottom line—financial performance and social impact. Others go even further in referring to the triple bottom line—economic, social, and environmental performance.</li>

<li>From the perspective of a stakeholder model, any organization has a social responsibility to serve the interests of its many stakeholders (Figure 14.7).&nbsp;</li>

<p>The classical view of CSR holds that management’s only responsibility in running a business is to maximize profits. In other words, “the business of business is business,” and the principal obligation of management should always be to owners and shareholders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is supported by Paul Samuelson, another distinguished economist and Nobel laureate. He states: “A large corporation these days not only may engage in social responsibility, it had damn well better try to do so.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>The social performance of business firms varies along a continuum that ranges from compliance-acting to avoid adverse consequences to conviction—acting to create positive impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 14.8, the continuum also varies in commitments to four criteria for evaluating social responsibility practices: economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="DiagramDescription automatically generated" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rBC_gelcW3XqHs8NVn3aQM5bcep9P853aCsr2K4USbeJzUp__6PmUV7B0dcvdxRcz9nq24olpprFXGb3gOkTrP2S5a6Cv8xlrTWxftDW3xUq-SqvVv_pqKFXYYrnWP-LVAC6XLzm1woL63reMgw80cpiOw=s2048" height="152" width="551"></p>
<ul>
<li>Thus, an audit of corporate social performance might cover these four questions:</li>
<li>Is the organization’s economic responsibility met—is it profitable?</li>
<li>Is the organization’s legal responsibility met—does it obey the law?</li>
<li>Is the organization’s ethical responsibility met—is it doing the “right” things?</li>
<li>Is the organization’s discretionary responsibility met—does it contribute to the broader community?</li>

<p><strong>Social Responsibility Strategies</strong></p>
<p>The decisions of people working at all levels in organizations ultimately determine whether or not practices are socially responsible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the executive level, these decisions can be viewed as “strategic”—ones designed to move the organization forward in its environment according to a long-term plan. And, of course, those plans can vary greatly depending on the executives’ viewpoints, organizational histories, and other factors.</p>

<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li>The obstructionist strategy (“Fight social demands”) focuses mainly on economic priorities with respect to social responsibility.&nbsp;</li>

<li>They try to satisfy economic, legal, and ethical criteria. Corporate behaviour at this level is consistent with society’s prevailing norms, values, and expectations, often reflecting the demands of outside pressures.&nbsp;</li>
<li>An oil company, for example, may be willing to “accommodate” with appropriate cleanup activities when a spill occurs, yet it may remain quite slow in taking actions to prevent spills in the first place.</li>
