  <title>SBI3U – First Day Welcome</title>

  <h2>SBI3U, Biology, Grade 11 University Preparation</h2>

  <h3>Welcome to SBI3U!</h3>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>SBI3U</strong>! This course will help you explore the structures and functions of living organisms, from the cellular level to entire systems. You will investigate the diversity of life, genetic processes, and the interrelationships between organisms and their environments. This course will build a strong foundation for Grade 12 biology and other life science courses.</p>
  <p>
    In this course, you will study diversity of living things, genetic processes, animals: structure and function, plants: anatomy, growth, and function, and evolution. You will also develop your skills in scientific investigation, critical thinking, and effective communication of scientific information.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Science, Grade 10, Academic (SNC2D).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    SBI3U will challenge you to apply your biological knowledge to real-world contexts and current issues in science and society. Through laboratory activities, projects, and discussions, you will strengthen your ability to collect and analyze data, draw conclusions, and present findings clearly.
  </p>
  <p>
    To succeed in this course, complete all assignments on time, participate actively in class, and maintain consistent study habits. The concepts in biology build on each other—regular review will help you keep pace.
