<p>The main components of blood are plasma and the cellular component,which includes red and white blood cells and platelets.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;The primary function of red blood cells, or erythrocytes, is to transport oxygen. Erythrocytes contain hemoglobin, which increases the amount of&nbsp;oxygen that can be carried in the blood. White blood cells, or leukocytes, are&nbsp;an important part of the immune system. Platelets initiate blood clotting.</li>
<li>The proportion of each component and the number of each type of cell in&nbsp;a specific volume of blood should fall within an acceptable range. Values&nbsp;outside this range may indicate a health problem.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Blood type incompatibility occurs when the donor blood has a marker but the recipient blood does not. The marker induces an antibody reaction in&nbsp;the recipient’s blood.</li>
<li>&nbsp;A person with blood type O is a universal donor, and a person with blood type AB is a universal recipient.</li>
<li>&nbsp;The rhesus, or Rh, factor is an antigen that also affects compatibility. Rh-positive individuals carry the antigen; Rh-negative individuals do not.</li>
<li>Research is being conducted in developing a product that can carry out the&nbsp;oxygenation function of red blood cells.</li>
<li>Arteries and arterioles are blood vessels that carry blood away from the&nbsp;heart. Arteries have a layer of smooth muscle in their walls. Vasoconstriction&nbsp;reduces the diameter of arteries and decreases blood flow. Vasodilation&nbsp;relaxes the muscle and increases blood flow.</li>
<li>The pulse is the expansion of an artery in response to the increased pressure&nbsp;caused by the contraction of the heart.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels. The capillary networks in the tissues are the locations where the exchange of materials takes place.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Blood pressure and flow rate decrease significantly when blood enters the capillary networks in the tissues. This provides time for the diffusion of&nbsp;materials into and out of the blood.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Veins and venules are blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart after it passes through the capillary networks in the tissues. Because blood pressure&nbsp;is low in the veins, valves and the contraction of skeletal muscles help move&nbsp;the blood back to the heart.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Blood pressure, measured with a sphygmomanometer, is reported as two values: systolic pressure (the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts)&nbsp;and diastolic pressure (the pressure in the arteries when the heart relaxes).</li>
<li>&nbsp;Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood pressure is consistently higher than normal.</li>
<li>The lymphatic system has two primary functions—to return excess fluids&nbsp;from the tissue fluid to the blood stream and to protect the body by filtering&nbsp;and destroying bacteria and other microorganisms.</li>
