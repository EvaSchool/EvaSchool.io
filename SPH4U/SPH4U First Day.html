    <h2>SPH4U, Grade 12 Physics</h2>

    <!-- 简要介绍 -->
    <p><strong>Welcome to SPH4U!</strong></p>
    <p>
      This course enables students to deepen their understanding of physics concepts and theories. You will investigate the laws of dynamics and energy transformations, explore gravitational, electric, and magnetic fields, and examine the wave nature of light, quantum mechanics, and special relativity. Emphasis will be placed on the scientific inquiry process and the development of analytical skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of this course, students will have gained experience in designing and conducting experiments, analyzing real-world phenomena through a physics lens, and communicating complex ideas effectively. These skills will prepare you for success in science, engineering, and related university-level programs.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> SPH3U (Grade 11 Physics), as specified by the Ontario Ministry of Education</p>

    <!-- 课程理念 -->
    <p>
      This course is designed to challenge your understanding of the physical world and encourage you to become a better scientific thinker. Physics is not about memorizing equations—it's about understanding the why and how behind the rules of nature. You’ll be encouraged to ask questions, form hypotheses, experiment, and draw meaningful conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This course values <em>critical thinking, curiosity, and problem-solving</em>. As you progress, take every opportunity to connect theory to real-world situations, collaborate with peers, and apply your knowledge creatively. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—every error is a step toward a deeper understanding.
    </p>
