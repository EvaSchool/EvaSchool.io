<h4>Defining Frames of Reference</h4>
<p>Frame of Reference a coordinate system relative to which motion is described or observed.</p>
<p>Inertial Frame of Reference a frame of reference that moves at a zero or constant velocity; a frame in which the law of inertia holds.</p>
<p>Non-inertial Frame of Reference a frame of reference that accelerates with respect to an inertial frame; the law of inertia does not hold.</p>
<p>Fictitious force an apparent but non-existent force invented to explain the motion of objects within an accelerating (non-inertial) frame of reference.</p>

<p>Think about riding on a bus. When the bus moves at a steady speed without changing direction, you could close your eyes and possibly not even be aware that the bus is moving. If you place a ball in the aisle of the bus, the ball does not move relative to the bus. When the bus slows down, however, you will see the ball roll forward.<br>When the bus speeds up again, the ball will roll backward. When the bus turns, the<br>ball will roll to the side. What forces cause the ball to accelerate? The fact is, no forces<br>act on the ball to accelerate it.</p>

<p>A person on the bus will view all motion from the point of view of the bus, so to her, the moving bus in Figure 1 is a moving frame of reference. A frame of reference is an observer’s choice of coordinate system, including an origin, for describing motion. A person standing on the sidewalk is in the stationary frame of reference of the ground. In many cases, people use the ground as a frame of reference, especially when they are not moving with respect to the ground. When you are at rest in a frame of reference that has a constant velocity, whether that frame is itself at rest (v &gt; 5 0) or moving with a non-zero velocity, your velocity relative to that frame is zero. When the bus is moving at a constant velocity, no net force acts on it. Therefore, no net force acts on you inside it. Newton’s first law of motion (the law of inertia) states that any object moving at a constant velocity (including v &gt; 5 0) remains at that velocity if no net force acts on it. The bus in this case is an inertial frame of reference, which is a frame of reference in which the law of inertia is valid.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Yibdqf_UiUMKYpZDrYmpfS9PO1Rj5Qcl0_HeV-flf4ukIfWo7TpHonpFQ7UJk4RrYHIMUom_v1FxuKhG89AEUgRjmrmrVrlJYEcu_Ld6Mf6r-6YwuaWUdno4nY3G_MFgFcsKsLbbitySdIKb9QaGcPmutg=s2048" height="212" width="517" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Now think about what happens when the bus slows down and the ball begins to roll forward inside the bus. What causes the ball to move forward? As the bus slows, it accelerates (that is, changes velocity) in a direction that is opposite to the direction of motion. Therefore, the bus is no longer an inertial frame of reference. It becomes a non-inertial frame of reference, which is a frame of reference in which the law of inertia is no longer valid. The reason there appears to be a net force on the ball is that the ball continues to move with the same velocity it had before. Obeying the law of inertia, the ball does not immediately slow down with the bus. Within the accelerating bus, or non-inertial frame of reference, this looks as if a force is pushing the ball forward.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/E_j3JL4hR9GdGVXpUISJtpxt_hQypAwxMQiab1qlyb63p5tHJH-Fyw4rEzDD9Nh4t7Edl3j0mMnQs-atERjrA3j7nQu13RZXK1yqd0DfDB7WXBm_DF23oJfHvjFdUxtpUfjnY52UDILdRqC8xPywJwo3IA=s2048" height="204" width="497" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Similarly, when the bus starts from rest and speeds up, the ball tends to stay at rest. To you and other passengers in the non-inertial frame, it appears as if there was a push on the ball toward the back of the bus. There also appears to be a force on the ball when the bus turns a corner. The ball continues moving in the same direction as the bus before the turn. From your point of view in the bus, this would be like a force pushing the ball in the &nbsp;direction opposite to that in which the bus was turning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To explain these various motions, we invent the idea of fictitious forces. Fictitious forces are apparent but non-existent forces that explain the motion in accelerating (non-inertial) frames of reference. In the bus example, a fictitious force pushed the ball in the direction opposite the acceleration of the bus. As you continue learning about<br>mechanics, you will encounter other fictitious forces. Fictitious forces simply explain non-accelerated motion in accelerated frames of reference. Tutorial 1 shows how to solve problems involving an object placed in a non-inertial frame of reference.</p>

<h4>Apparent weight</h4>
<p>the magnitude of&nbsp;the normal force acting on an object in an accelerated &nbsp;(non-inertial) frame of reference.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/E4WoKy0yQ1gxa_XOBcYnev-CRYO7p-T8CkxxPTc3vr4gm1f8dKAXAg9p0Xrps_Mx_oD_H0Ot_eIsNew8xCclknA2DgKwqYj1mRBRYelvMC6q8p9X9YzYE8CVrE80rE31btvD6bMdd88rZrQA1HVYCqFvRg=s2048" height="456px;" width="292px;" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The study of vertical acceleration can also introduce fictitious forces. To understand this, consider what happens when you stand on a bathroom scale. As<br>in all cases when you stand up, you feel a force pushing upward against the soles of your feet. This is the normal force, and it is equal and opposite to the weight (mg) of your body when you stand on level ground.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Vui1DtiEkUFc0xAf898KEjO13fgFebfHWb31PytA4LJs5K29bJ3Ry6rPcG2uXRCvuivaGBtpSRPxOC39aTamcwhIJDsFN6JCnder1sqyHS84dHy6J4vThwscBIEIrVBRrWKQYtOJH5kOaLMURueD6TU9Yw=s2048" height="486px;" width="256px;" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Now suppose that you stand on the same scale inside an elevator. When the elevator is at rest, the normal force is again the same as your weight. This is also true when the elevator is moving at a constant non-zero speed upward or downward. However, what happens when the elevator accelerates? When the elevator accelerates downward, the normal force decreases, so that the magnitude of the reading on the scale is less than your weight, mg. Similarly, when the elevator accelerates upward, the normal force increases, resulting in a greater reading on the scale.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4VzwXmORRUJrew45HnJ-EW5jeV2sKnoEy63HyPlAxnP4V_e4qllcDfc1E-0sBz9SsJOdVmrLLadwqnu5bHh21WFOlQ-BXolFfkFqqUwNOuKjXPBi1s-l7bcX7JQVqFJBYX999DaB7-ipKr9pN5RDmuptrg=s2048" height="486px;" width="254px;" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>As with the bus at the beginning of this section, the elevator can be an inertial frame of reference when it has a constant velocity going up or down. It becomes a non-inertial frame of reference when it accelerates, resulting in a normal force that is either greater or less than your weight. The magnitude of this normal force in a non-inertial frame of reference is called the apparent weight. Other non-inertial frames of reference produce other values for apparent weight. On a free-fall ride at an amusement park, the acceleration of the ride is equal to g, and the normal force is zero.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-mbudScgDsLg6a611MwoA8foGX6ZDwAyzq55pg304aic2_TccKtMunaiO4lN7m2p_TJIlCnrI2xkxPMIqcAwfCpPGWSVso8ux4ze_QPns19OkPP2a2LbRt1PXRdJvuzqwHp4h_YIkvYzZTuE081_mGlx1A=s2048" height="433px;" width="263px;" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Thus, the scale will read an apparent weight of zero. Similarly, an astronaut aboard the International Space Station is constantly in&nbsp;free fall. Therefore, the normal force acting on the astronaut is zero.</p>

<h2>Now let’s try to solve some problems:</h2>
<p>An elevator accelerates upward with an acceleration of magnitude 1.5 m/s2, after which it moves with a constant velocity. As the elevator approaches its stopping point, it undergoes a downward acceleration of magnitude 0.9 m/s2. Calculate the apparent weight of a passenger with a mass of 75 kg when:<br>(a) the elevator undergoes positive acceleration<br>(b) the elevator moves at constant velocity<br>(c) the elevator undergoes negative acceleration</p>
