  <title>SCH3U – First Day Welcome</title>

  <h2>SCH3U, Chemistry, Grade 11 University Preparation</h2>

  <h3>Welcome to SCH3U!</h3>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>SCH3U</strong>! This course will deepen your understanding of chemistry concepts and strengthen your skills in scientific investigation. You will explore the structure and properties of matter, chemical reactions, and the quantitative relationships in those reactions. The knowledge and skills you gain will prepare you for Grade 12 chemistry and related university programs.</p>
  <p>
    This course covers matter, chemical bonding, chemical reactions, solutions and solubility, and gases and atmospheric chemistry. You will develop scientific inquiry skills through hands-on experiments, virtual labs, and problem-solving activities. Emphasis will be placed on applying chemical concepts to real-world situations and communicating your findings effectively.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Science, Grade 10, Academic (SNC2D).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    SCH3U will encourage you to think critically about the role of chemistry in everyday life and in global issues. You will improve your ability to design experiments, interpret data, and evaluate the reliability of sources. These skills are essential not only for advanced science courses but also for any future study requiring analytical thinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    To succeed in this course, stay on top of assignments, practice problems regularly, and seek help when you encounter challenges. Consistent effort and curiosity will lead to success.
