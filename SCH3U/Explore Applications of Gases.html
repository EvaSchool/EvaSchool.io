<h2>Burning Snowballs&nbsp;</h2>
<p>It seems unlikely... a snowball of fire (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). What you see is a gas hydrate: molecules of gases, including methane, trapped inside ice (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). As you know, methane is a non-polar molecule and water is polar, so normally the two do not mix. Gas hydrates only form under low temperatures and high pressures. The gases are produced by the breakdown of organic matter. Some estimates predict that more organic carbon is contained in gas hydrates than in all other known fossil fuel sources combined: perhaps 10,000 G (gigatonne)!&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Application&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Our ever-increasing demand for fossil fuels is encouraging exploration for unlikely substances. The sea floor has large deposits of gas hydrates. The extraction of gas hydrates is quite controversial because of the potential environmental impact and our continued reliance on fossil fuels.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>You are a researcher with a new Canadian oil and gas exploration company. The company is considering "mining" gas hydrates as a source of natural gas. You are to conduct some initial research to help the company decide whether to pursue this idea. As the company is trying to be environmentally responsible, they also want information on the environmental impacts of extracting and using gas hydrates.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Your Goal</h2>
<p>To provide the oil and gas company with objective, factual information to help them decide whether to explore for gas hydrates.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Research&nbsp;</h2>
<p><strong>Focus your research on the following topics:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>gas hydrate deposit locations around Canada&nbsp;</li>
<li>cost of gas hydrate recovery, compared with other fossil fuels&nbsp;</li>
<li>challenges of gas hydrate mining in Arctic waters&nbsp;</li>
<li>environmental effects of gas hydrate recovery&nbsp;</li>
<li>effects on climate change of release of gas hydrates from Arctic ice impact on air quality of burning methane compared to burning other&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fuels&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Summarize&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Extract the main points of your research, ensuring that you address all of the topics listed above.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Communicate&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Summarize your findings in a brief, factual, unbiased report for the executives of the oil and gas company. Your report should be supported by references to reputable sources of information. Be prepared to also present an oral summary of your research results.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Plan for Action&nbsp;</h2>
<p>While gas hydrate extraction might have its benefits, there is no denying the fact that burning methane releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. What can you do to reduce the need to burn fossil fuels? Is your school or your home heated by natural gas? Make a plan involving at least three strategies to reduce the quantity of natural gas used for heating.&nbsp;</p>
