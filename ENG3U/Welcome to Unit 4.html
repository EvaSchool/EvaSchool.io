<h1>Welcome to Unit 4</h1>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unit 4 offers a comprehensive study of verb tenses and sentence structures alongside an immersive exploration of Trevor Noah's memoir, Born a Crime. The unit begins with a focus on verb tenses, introducing students to simple and continuous tenses, followed by an in-depth examination of perfect and perfect continuous tenses. Through practical exercises and examples, students gain a solid understanding of how to use these tenses effectively in their writing. Building on this grammatical foundation, the unit progresses to an exploration of sentence types based on function and structure. Students learn to identify and construct various sentence types, enhancing their ability to communicate effectively and express ideas with clarity and precision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A significant aspect of Unit 4 is the introduction to Trevor Noah's memoir, Born a Crime. Students are provided with background information and setting details to contextualize their reading experience. They embark on the journey of reading the memoir, starting with Chapters I-IV, and progressively move through the subsequent chapters with the guidance of accompanying lessons designed to deepen their comprehension and appreciation of the text.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>As students progress through the unit, they continue to engage with Born a Crime, delving into Chapters V-XIII and concluding with Chapters XIV-XVII. Alongside their reading, they receive instruction and support to aid in their understanding of the book's themes, characters, and narrative structure. Through this immersive literary experience, students not only enhance their language skills but also develop critical thinking and analytical abilities. Overall, Unit 4 offers a rich blend of language mechanics and literary exploration, providing students with a holistic learning experience.</p>
