<h1>Welcome to Unit 5</h1>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unit 5 marks the culmination of the course, focusing on a final rich summative task that integrates various skills and concepts learned throughout the curriculum. Students are guided through this task and provided with an opportunity to manage their time effectively in completing it, ensuring a comprehensive and well-executed final project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A significant aspect of Unit 5 is the introduction to different literary theories, offering students a deeper understanding of various critical approaches to literary analysis. Through examples and explanations, students learn how each literary theory can be applied to a literary text. They are tasked with selecting a literary theory to apply to their chosen novel, facilitating a nuanced and in-depth analysis of the text.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing with the exploration of literary theories, students are guided on how to utilize two different theories to analyze their chosen novel. This comparative approach enhances students' critical thinking skills and encourages them to consider multiple perspectives in their literary analysis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, students engage in interactive activities designed to apply literary theories to various excerpts, providing practical experience and reinforcing their understanding of how to effectively apply these theories in their independent novel study. Through these activities, students develop proficiency in applying literary theories to literary texts, equipping them with essential analytical skills for future literary endeavors. Overall, Unit 5 offers a comprehensive and immersive culmination of the course, enabling students to demonstrate their mastery of literary analysis and critical thinking.</p>
