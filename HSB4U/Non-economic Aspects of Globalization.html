<li><strong>Nation- </strong>state is a term used to describe a state or country in terms of geography, politics, and cultural identity.<br>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Japan is an example of a nation-state in which the people speak the same language, practice the same religion, and share a set of national values.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sovereignty is an important feature of a nation-state, which means having its system of law, currency, and bureaucracy under a recognized government.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The importance of nation-states under globalization is being reduced as many national functions are being replaced by international agreements. As a result, “world politics” are becoming increasingly more important than the politics of individual nation-states.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Group of Eight (G8) summit is an annual meeting of leaders from eight of the most powerful countries in the world. It started as G6 in 1975 with the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan, and Germany.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">With the addition of Canada in 1976, it became the G7 and then finally to G8 when Russia joined in 1998. The summit tackles pressing global issues and plans what actions to take. G8 is an example of political globalization which refers to the process in which world politics is becoming increasingly integrated, resulting in the creation of organizations that collaborate on world issues.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The spread of infectious diseases, financial crises, and climate change, all affect the security, and prosperity of all countries and therefore call for global initiatives. The world community responds through joint resources and commitment.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Countries come together to form organizations to solve a specific global issue which is referred to as <strong>multilateralism.</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The United Nations (UN), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank (WB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are examples of multilateral organizations created in response to global issues.</li>

<p><strong>Globalization and Human Rights</strong></p>
<p>The UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948, as a result of the atrocities experienced during the Second World War.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vowing not to allow atrocities again of such magnitude proportion, the members decided to complement the UN Charter with a document that would guarantee the rights of every individual, everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>It has the following articles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.</li>
<li>Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms outlined in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or another opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or another status.</li>
<li>No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.</li>
<li>Slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.</li>
<li>And no one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, this Declaration is not always adhered to. Globalization in theory should result in the creation of one global village where there is a free flow of capital, goods, services, and ideas. However the effect of globalization on human rights has been controversial.</p>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">This type of globalization relates to how the world’s increasing interconnectedness leads to a “shared” global culture - common values, ideas, and ways of life among individuals from across the world. Many factors contribute to cultural globalization, advancements in air travel being one of them.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Before the COVID-19 pandemic, people were traveling more frequently and more widely than ever before. Therefore they are being exposed to different cultures, values, and ideas. We have talked about in our previous lessons how television, the mass media and communication technologies, and the Internet have become the primary instruments of bringing cultural globalization.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Some critics of cultural globalization are wary that individual countries are becoming fragmented, their values are beginning to be lost as growing numbers of immigrants introduce new customs, as international trade increases, and modern media communications invade every corner of the world displacing local culture. Some even see it as generating cultural homogenization or the blending of different cultural practices into one uniform cultural practice. This practice to some extent becomes cultural repression which happens when large international corporations can bring cheap goods to global markets thereby displacing local retailers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Another controversial aspect of globalization is the worldwide spread and dominance of Western, or “American,” culture. This happened as a result of advances in mass communication where today’s society, music, television, film, and the Internet allow the global spread of ideas and values, most of which are Western, or American.</li>

<td style="border-width: 2px; border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result, teenagers from around the globe become aware of whatever is American and may begin to adopt them in their own lives. Another manner of transmitting American culture is through the global spread of American corporations threatening the very core of a nation’s culture.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Examples are the proliferation of McDonald’s Corporation, a burger chain, and Starbucks Corporation, a coffeehouse chain, both are American multinational corporations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They not only affect the eating habits of the locals but also influence the traditions and mores in the countries where they are located.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take for example the case of Starbucks in Italy. There, drinking coffee is associated with socialization - a time to relax at outside cafés and chat with friends - unlike in the US where it is common for people to buy take-out coffee for drinking at home, in the car, or in the office.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;"><strong>For the Italians, a large coffee chain like Starbucks cannot provide the personal and friendly atmosphere local coffee shops offer.</strong></li>
