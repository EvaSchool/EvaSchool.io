<li>Participation in the global market requires the ability to compete in a large-scale market. Competition for resources, sales, and profits leads to the exploitation of the more vulnerable economies.

<li>This demand and the profit potential encourage some people to provide goods to satisfy the unmet supply through illegal means.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">The Global Population&nbsp;</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">How many people can our world sustain? The world had an estimated population of 7.6 billion in 2019 sparking concerns that we are overburdening our planet. With more and more people competing for a finite supply of resources, conflict becomes inevitable.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">China’s example of curbing its population growth is the implementation of “one-child policy” in 1979.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It was later revised to allow rural families to have a second child if the first-born is a daughter and in case of other circumstances it was eventually relaxed to a two-child limit around 2013.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In Canada and other parts of Europe, women are having fewer children without government intervention.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canada has a 2016 population of 35,151,728 which gained a significant increase of 5% from 2011. The next census will be done this year, 2021.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Fertility rate is the number of live children a woman bears in her lifetime. This is an important factor for population growth.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For a population to replace itself, the ideal total fertility rate is 2.1 assuming that no immigration occurs and taking into account the mortality conditions between 0-15 years old.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">This is known as the replacement fertility rate or the average number of children that a woman of one generation would need to give birth to result in a generation of the same size.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canada’s fertility rate in 2016 was 1.54 (children per woman). Across the world, women today are having half the number of children their grandparents had and the global average number of children per family is 2.5.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Food Production</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In 2016, the agricultural and agri-food system sector accounted for 6.7% of Canada’s gross domestic product which employs roughly 2.3 million people representing 12.5% of Canadian employment in the same year. The way food is grown has changed over time. It used to be a family business, but it has shifted to large-scale production.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The production and processing of food products today is a multi-trillion-dollar industry worldwide. For a small Canadian farmer, it is increasingly difficult to compete with prices offered by large-scale farming industries. As a result, some families on smaller farms have become more dependent on non-farm income. This trend is the same on a global scale.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canada has the second-best ratio of arable land-to-population ratio in the world: 1:3 hectares per person. It means Canada possesses the land needed to grow and produce food and expand its capacity to produce, and it has a relatively small population.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In contrast, Japan’s limited area and large population give them less land to expand production.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Given Canada’s vastness of land, it should be a major production force on the world stage, but this is not the case. Canada needs to increase its global competitiveness in food production, without sacrificing its efforts to protect and preserve the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Increased global food production means increased demand for other resources such as oil and fresh water to produce it. The environmental footprint created by the production and consumption of food and energy is a global concern. Alternative sources (e.g., fuel, energy, water) must be found for the increased demand. From planting to final processing, all the machines involved in food production require energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the environmental cost of transporting food around the world puts stress on other finite resources like fuel, oil, and electricity. Canada is becoming less self-sufficient by relying less on its resources and more on imported food products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If this trend continues, Canada could lose its capacity to produce its food and become more dependent on other growers to feed Canadian families. Maybe a change in the country’s agricultural policies is needed to make it more globally competitive and ensure its self-reliance in the years to come.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">The Black Market</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Simple economics dictate that where there is demand, supply will follow. Because of the world economic order, supply can come anywhere in the world. If there is a large demand, there will be more than one supplier competing to meet the demand.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sale and smuggling of illegal substances like drugs, is a major problem worldwide. Millions of dollars are spent tracking, seizing, and prosecuting people working in the illegal drug trade. Consider the case of the Taliban in Afghanistan whose principal source of income is the control of the illegal opium trade which is needed to produce heroin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>What the Taliban does is offer “protection” to the smugglers, farmers, and drug distributors in exchange for operating in their territory. They demand a portion of the profits earned by the people they “protect.” It is estimated that the Taliban earns nearly $300 million a year from the opium trade, which they use to fund their organization.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">One factor influencing sales is demand. Growing a crop that commands a high price makes good economic sense (ethical considerations aside). The question is, do the social problems associated with the production of crops such as opium poppies outweigh the farmers’ desire to take care of their families?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">There is too much money to be made from the drug trade for it to disappear. The only way to solve this problem is to eliminate the demand for this product. No demand means few incentives to grow and produce it.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In Canada, one product that requires a constant supply stream is cigarettes. Its demand outpaces its production so outside sources that grow tobacco are needed. In the province of Ontario, tobacco production and processing are tightly regulated.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Cigarettes are also highly taxed, making them expensive to purchase. The purpose of the tax is to deter buyers and raise revenue for the government. Too much tax, however, encourages buyers to seek illegal sources for their tobacco products.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; text-wrap: wrap;"><span style="border: none;"><img height="185" width="275" src="image_19500572921709071632904_20240227220724067.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A cache of smuggled guns</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The black market consists of unregulated sellers who do not have to follow any health or safety standards when producing their products. The black market dealers also do not pay taxes to the government.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Goods and services are obtained for a lower price but there is a greater risk for the consumer because of the absence of government guarantees and protection standards. Proceeds of tobacco smuggling and sales are used to fund other illegal activities such as narcotics sales and gun smuggling.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It must be so profitable for competing criminal organizations to fight for sales areas, which is a societal problem. Police and health services have to be increased to deal with the consequences as the flow of unregulated products becomes available on the market. Ironically, raising the tax meant to reduce the use of an unhealthy product can contribute to an even greater problem by encouraging organized crime.</li>
