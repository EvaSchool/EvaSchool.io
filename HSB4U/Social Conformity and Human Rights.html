<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">So why do people choose to conform to social rules?</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">French philosopher <strong>Michel Foucault (1926-1984)</strong> theorized that governments control people through fear. Governments can get further into the lives of individuals by giving them power and control over observation laws or rules about observing and collecting data about people.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is about the idea that if people know they are being observed, they most likely will follow the rules. Foucault believed that our society has evolved from a “culture of spectacle” to a “carceral culture.”</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It means a culture in which people correct their behavior out of fear of being observed. In the late 1700s, public displays of torture were commonly inflicted on citizens to ensure rules were followed. Today, punishment and discipline are internalized and are directed toward the rehabilitation of non-conformists.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is a more subtle form of population control through constant surveillance and information collection and storage is used to keep people following society’s rules.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">The Panopticon Model</h2>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space-collapse: preserve;"><span style="border: none;"><img height="131" width="307" src="image_26593570241709075799249_20240227231652591.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A panopticon</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Panopticon describes a theoretical model of a prison with cells that were visible from a centralized tower. Here, a person in a cell cannot interact with other prisoners and is constantly visible to the central tower.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Prisoners see when they are being viewed and believe they can be viewed at any moment. This constant threat of observation keeps them following the rules. The power lies in the tower because they can decide to observe at any time.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Through this model, Foucault theorized that society functions in a similar way where the citizens are being observed and that the fear of being observed keeps them in line. Control of people has been enhanced through technology. Government agencies have more sophisticated tools to track people that are integrated into everyday life.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The panoptic model of observation is diffused throughout society through cellular phones, telephones, social security numbers, ATMs, passwords for any type of machine, credit cards, Internet access, and an increasing number of surveillance cameras in public and private spaces that track and record actions of people and can be used to follow movements of a person throughout the day.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Human Rights in Canada</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Canadian human rights code is patterned after the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It includes rights such as the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person, the right to not be kept in slavery for any reason, and the right to be represented by the law.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space-collapse: preserve;"><span style="border: none;"><img height="189" width="227" src="image_52509568831709075798759_20240227231652587.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;"><strong>A niqab (left) and a burka (right)</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">There remains an ongoing debate on when are the laws applied and when can an individual claim freedom of expression as an explanation for his or her actions. A common example is the right to wear head or face coverings (niqabs or burkas) of Muslim women during the swearing-in ceremony to become a Canadian citizen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Immigration Minister Jason Kennedy, “Allowing a group to hide their faces while they are becoming members of our community is counter to Canada’s commitment to openness, equality, and social cohesion.” Women on the other hand can vote without showing their faces and have the option to show their faces to a female security officer only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Ontario, the Human Rights Code was penned in the mid-1940s. It prohibits discrimination in the areas of goods and facilities, services, housing, employment, contracts, and membership in associations or trade unions, based on ancestry, place of origin, race, ethnic origin, creed, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, receipt of assistance, and disability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Code is quasi-constitutional - it is not a constitutional law but is treated like one - and has primacy over most laws in Ontario. It is not meant to be a punitive tool, but financial compensation and changes in practice are applied to perpetrators.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Human Smuggling and Human Trafficking</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Human smuggling is the act of illegally bringing people into the country and providing false documentation for them. People are sometimes forced to decide to enter a country illegally to avoid complex immigration restrictions or lengthy application processes. Globalization and the search for work and a better life have created a demand for smugglers to transport desperate people to more developed countries.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is not uncommon to hear nationals from poorer countries being smuggled into countries like Canada in search of a better life.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Human trafficking involves the recruitment, transportation, and harboring of a person for forced service using deception, debt bondage, or coercion. The number of victims is difficult to calculate because of the underground nature of human smuggling and trafficking.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Estimates are only based on seizures and known cases. Forced labor and sexual exploitation are the most common purposes of trafficking. It is prevalent in poorer countries where a common tactic is to offer a person living in poverty a good job in another city or country. They are forced into prostitution or another form of slavery.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Children often end up as victims when they are sold by their parents to traffickers to pay off debts or to gain income for the family. Every country in the world is affected by trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit, or destination for victims.</li>
