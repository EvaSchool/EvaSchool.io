<li style="text-align: justify;">When we hear the term globalization, we immediately think of an integrated economic system or a global marketplace.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">it is primarily driven by Western countries, globalization generally results in the spread of Western ideals and culture.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is for this reason that globalization is often explained in terms of the relationship between developed Western countries and the rest of the world.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This section discusses four theories that provide the framework to study the social phenomena of economic globalization, and more specifically to examine social behavior and the factors that cause societal change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>They are the modernization theory, dependency theory, the world-systems theory, and the new international division of labor theory.</strong></p>

<h2 class="card-title">Modernization Theory</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p><img src="image_91469243581709065073935_20240227201806596.png" alt="" title="" width="393" height="302" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Emerged in the late 1940s and popularized in the 1950s, this theory aims to identify how past and present societies are modernized and how societies react to modernization.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is said to focus on how “traditional” or underdeveloped societies are transformed into “modern” or Western societies.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">This theory believes in the idea that humans can develop and change their society.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">This is made possible by advancements in technology and other areas of industry.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Such technological advancements resulted in more job opportunities, increased production, and what is known as economic growth, thereby enabling low-income societies to move to middle- and then high-income societies.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Modernization is not limited to economic growth but also through changes in social, political, and cultural systems, as suggested by modernization theory.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Since globalization results from sharing resources, ideas, and information, it consequently increases shared customs, values, and ideals between nations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To achieve modernization, American economist Walt <strong>Whitman Rostow (1916-2003)</strong> suggested that countries pass through five stages of economic development.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Known as the Stages of Economic Growth model, Rostow identified several conditions that were likely to occur at each stage of economic growth before modernization was achieved.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">This model of economic growth became one of the most important concepts in modernization theory.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Rostow added to the theory that as societies shift from values based on tradition towards values based on rational exchange, it makes people become more receptive to change and more concerned with individual rights and personal achievements. This leads to market- and growth-based economic change.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="card-title">Dependency Theory</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">As observed by some economists, economic growth brought about by globalization in industrialized countries did not automatically spur the same in developing countries.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Thus, in reaction to modernization theory, the dependency theory emerged in the late 1950s which explained a one-way direction of the flow of wealth from the poor, underdeveloped countries to wealthier countries.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; text-wrap: wrap;"><span style="border: 3pt solid rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img height="265" width="198" src="pic2_20240227201806596.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Argentinian economist <strong>Raúl Prebisch (1901-1986)</strong> formulated the basis for this theory after conducting studies that suggested that economic activity in developed Western countries often led to serious economic problems in underdeveloped countries.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Developing countries export raw materials to developed countries for processing because: developing countries do not have the technology to finish the products while developed countries lack the necessary resources to create finished goods.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Developed countries then sell them back at a higher price than what they paid for the raw materials.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In short, developing countries provide resources, cheap labor, and a market for developed countries, which all the more make the latter more prosperous.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Prebisch added that the spread of poverty in developing countries is due to the way they are integrated into the world markets, rather than because they have not reached the stage of modernization, as claimed by modernization theory.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Dependency theory further noted the unbalanced and unfair terms of trade between developed and developing countries. Some theorists even put it bluntly by saying that global poverty is at least partially attributable to the exploitation of the developing countries by the developed ones.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">For them, unless these unfair terms of trade are changed, the developing and underdeveloped countries will never reach the sustained economic growth patterns of the advanced capitalist economies.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">“Fair trade” has become the battle cry for the developing world as it came to be known as a social movement that aims to create greater equity in international trade and to promote local sustainability.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Fairtrade organizations promote that fair trade practices alleviate poverty, enhance gender equity, improve working conditions, consider the environment, and promote distributive justice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does fair trade work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Fairtrade organizations buy products from developing countries at prices more than the existing market price.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They then sell these products in developed countries at a higher price for being tagged as “fair trade” products that alleviate global poverty.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">These organizations encourage higher social and environmental standards for exported commodities.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A fair trade certification label tells that the product is produced, traded, processed, and packaged according to certain standards.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Typical fair trade products include handicrafts, cotton, honey, chocolate, coffee, cocoa, sugar, tea, and bananas.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Many concerned consumers in the developed world are willing to pay a higher price for these products because of the belief that it will benefit the poor farmers where the products are sourced.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">While fair trade intends to ensure that farmers receive a higher proportion of the revenues from the sale of exported commodities, there has been much criticism of how much money goes into the farmers.</li>

<h2 class="small" style="text-align: center;">World-Systems Theory</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; text-wrap: wrap;"><span style="border: 3pt solid rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img height="219" width="197" src="pic3_20240227201806596.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Around the time when modernization theory came under attack by the dependency theory, a new approach emerged from the works of American sociologist <strong>Immanuel Wallerstein (1930-2019).</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">His world-systems theory suggested that there is a world economic system that should be the primary unit of focus of social theory on economic development rather than the nation-states.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">This approach emphasizes the social structure of global inequality in which some countries benefit while others are exploited.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">By the late 1970s, this theory had established itself as an alternative perspective from which to examine issues of development and world inequalities.</li>

<p><strong>The so-called global economy caused the emergence of a structure of global production, known as global commodity chains which is a complex pattern of international labor and production processes that result in a finished commodity, ready for sale in the marketplace. It works like this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A raw material (e.g., rubber or copper) is extracted from one part of the world.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Then it is processed in another area to produce consumer goods (running shoes for rubber and cell phones for copper).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The final products or goods are then distributed in core markets (where they were originally designed) as well as in other foreign markets.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In theory, the introduction of foreign investments is supposed to be beneficial to developing countries in the form of job creation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sad reality, however, is that profits from foreign investments rarely stay in these countries, much more improving the lives of the workers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of the profits go to the owners or the capitalists or to pay for the costs like shipping, storage, and sales taxes in high-income countries.</p>
