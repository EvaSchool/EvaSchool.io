<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recording and Organizing Information and Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Once a social scientist has collected the data and information, a vital part that comes next is recording and then organizing them so that they can be presented understandably for analysis and interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are several methods researchers use for recording their data. The widely used ones are writing <strong>fieldnotes, video</strong> or <strong>audio</strong> taping and even<strong> filming </strong>of the participants’ verbal and non-verbal responses and/or behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using one or the other depends on the nature and purpose of the research, the setting, and the available financial resources. Real-time visual connections are also used (e.g., Skype, Facetime, Zoom) which are web/internet based. Aside from being useful, they are also cost-effective.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Always remember to observe proper handling and storage of material to avoid risks of being lost, erased, stolen, or falling into the wrong hands.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Precautions as to the posting of research-related images of minor subjects must be observed at all times.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Paper-and-pen-based research tools are excellent sources of data and information. It is advisable to have data recording sheets prepared in advance to make the process easier and quicker.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">This may contain checkboxes, Likert-type scales (numeric, such as 1-5), specific boxes for notes, or other features to make data recording more efficient and organized.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Organizing the data is a way of bringing them together systematically to make it easier to read and understand.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">One simple way of organizing quantitative data is counting by tallying. It gives the frequency of a certain event.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Another great technique for organizing data is writing effective research questions that diligently follow the research plan. It is important to ensure that the questions you ask the participants will help you answer the research question while being flexible enough to test alternative ideas.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Canada At A Glance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canada is the second largest country in the world in terms of the land area it occupies covering a total of 9.98 million square kilometers.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It has ten provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan) and three territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon) and is located in the northern part of North America.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">As of the last 2016 census from Statistics Canada, Canada has a population of 35,151,728 compared to 33,476,688 in 2011.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It gained a significant increase of 5% over the five years.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canada registered 383,102 births in 2016, while deaths reached 267,213. The country’s fertility rate in the same year is 1.54 (children per woman).</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Immigration Patterns</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Aside from births and deaths, international migration is one of the key factors influencing population change, and this is very evident in Canadian society. The most recent data released by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) as of April 2020 shows the top ten source countries of immigrants.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">They are led by India where the majority speak English fluently and possess other eligible characteristics for immigration, followed by China, the Philippines, USA, Nigeria, Pakistan, Syria, France, Iran, and Brazil.</li>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">5,774,342 travel documents were issued to visitors, workers, and students.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">404,369 temporary work permits were issued under the temporary foreign worker and international mobility programs.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">74,586 individuals transitioned from temporary to permanent residents.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">341,180 permanent residents were admitted in Canada.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">About 8,500 French-speaking permanent residents were admitted to Canada outside Quebec with additional support for francophone communities across Canada.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">IRCC created, implemented, and expanded 10 different programs and initiatives related to GBA+.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Permanent and non-permanent immigration accounted for over 80% of Canada’s population growth.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">About 58% of permanent residents are admitted under the economic category.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">30,087 refugees resettled, the highest number of any state worldwide.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Immigrants including the new arrivals are more likely to settle in the nation’s three large urban areas - Toronto, Vancouver, and Montréal, but the prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) are also getting their fair share</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">New migrants are drawn to these large urban centers largely because of bigger economic opportunities and the availability of their developed social networks. The 2016 census revealed that 7,540,830 foreign-born individuals came to Canada through the immigration process, representing 21.9% of the country’s total population. This means more than one in five Canadians are foreign-born.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">The Future of Canada’s Population</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In 2016, Canada’s life expectancy at birth was 82 years for both sexes</strong>, where men are at 79.9 years while women have a higher number of 84 years. Life expectancy at 65 is placed at 20.8 years for both sexes with men having 19.3 years while women are said to have 22.1 years. It is said that improvement in life expectancy is due to a combination of factors that have had a positive impact on the lifespan of Canadians. These include affordable medications, universal healthcare, and social programs that support families.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Statistics Canada reported that in 2019, there were 372,038 live births in the country, excluding the Yukon Territory. The proportion of boys is slightly higher (51.3%) than the proportion of girls (48.7%).&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The 2019 total fertility rate (TFR) declined to 1.47 births per woman compared to 1.54 in 2016. It is said to be a record low where in 1959, it was 3.94 births per woman. Canada’s TFR continued to decline since 2009 from 1.68. TFR is a very important factor in population growth.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Scientists believe that a TFR of 2.1 is ideal for the population to replace itself, assuming that no immigration occurs, as well as taking into account mortality conditions between 0-15 years old. This is known as the replacement fertility rate or the average number of children that a woman of one generation would need to give birth to result in a generation of the same size.&amp;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Understanding fertility rates gives an edge for proper planning of resources in a given territory. It is also important to know the following distribution of the population by broad age groups: 0-14 years comprise 16.6%; 15-64 years has the lion’s share at 66.5%; while those 65 years and over represent 19.1% (Statistics Canada, 2016 Census).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">In 2006, the senior/retried group only comprised 13% of the population. Their significant growth will have implications on the government coffers going to pensions and social welfare programs. This may imply that those in the labor force have to work longer years or start saving earlier to prepare for retirement.</li>
</ul>

<div class="card-header">
<h2 class="card-title">Language</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canada is a bilingual country, with French and English as official languages that are given equal status by the government under the Official Languages Act of 1969. English, however, remains the universal language spoken by all to communicate with one another. In recent years, however, due to the influx of migrants, linguistic diversity has been on the rise among Canadian households. More Canadians are speaking a mother tongue or language at home other than English or French. Statistics Canada refers to this as “other languages” which can be divided into two broad categories: Aboriginal languages and immigrant languages.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Aboriginal languages are traditionally spoken by the aboriginal peoples of Canada (i.e., First Nations or North American Indians, Métis, and Inuit). The Assembly of First Nations (AFN) and Heritage Canada are working together to maintain, protect, and preserve their language and culture. It is even embedded in laws such as in Section 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 protecting Aboriginal rights.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The strong increase in immigrant languages is driven by international migration being the core of population growth in the country. In 2016, 7.7 million people reported to be speaking immigrant mother languages, compared to 6.8 million in 2011, registering a significant increase of 13%. The first five mother tongues spoken by more than 100,000 people in 2016 are Mandarin (1), Cantonese (2), Punjabi (3), Tagalog (Filipino Pilipino) (4), and Spanish (5). Seventy-five percent of them reside in the six largest census metropolitan areas - Montréal, Ottawa-Gatineau, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Some visible changes that show how culture is being integrated and assimilated into Canadian culture are street signs in British Columbia. One will find that these signs are written in both English and Chinese or English and Punjabi to accommodate the large number of Chinese and Indian people living there. Have you noticed any of these signs in your respective communities?</li>
