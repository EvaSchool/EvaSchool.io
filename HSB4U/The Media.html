<p>The media is composed of communication tools to store or deliver information. Popular media comes in many different formats including print, audiovisual (television, cinema, music), and digital (video games, software, and the Internet).</p>
<p>Each form of media can entertain, create, influence, motivate, and clarify. The media provides a constant stream of information. For many people, it is within this reality that they gain an understanding of how to interpret the world around them.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Media Consumption</h2>

<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Canadian media is doing good in keeping Canadians informed of what is happening within the country and around the world. This barrage of information influences how people act, the choices they make, and even what they think of themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A report entitled Canada Time Spent with Media 2019 shows the following statistics:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Consumers spend at least 10 hours daily or 41% of the hours in a day on some type of media.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Digital media use has become ahead of traditional media as it is driven by the use of mobile devices and a healthy appetite for digital video.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Digital now accounts for 50.1% of total media time spent following a decade of increased media access made possible by digital devices and groundbreaking news services; digital video’s popularity is bolstered by Netflix and YouTube.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Time spent on digital video about TV is higher in Canada than in any other country.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Mobile devices now make up almost a third of all media time - on par with TV.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The heavy reliance on smartphones and tablets for breaking news and social networking has stolen time from desktops and laptops.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time spent with traditional media formats like TV, radio, and print is declining, but the reach of TV and radio keeps them as the go-to source for specific use cases (e.g., auto commutes maintain a committed audience to terrestrial radio).</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Read this <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/canada-time-spent-with-media-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> for additional information.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teenagers spend their screen time for both educational and social purposes. The time they spend consuming media is said to be equal to the workweek of many adults. Access to wireless networks is offered for free in many places including train stations, bus terminals, airports, hotels, and restaurants. This allows more access to the Internet and more time spent online by Canadians.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Young people are regarded to have the ability to perform higher-order thought processes to filter these messages. Too much exposure, however, could make the messages so common and may seem normal to them. This could in turn lead to their understanding and interpretation of the world that is different from reality.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space-collapse: preserve;"><span style="border: none;"><img height="209" width="152" src="pic0_20240226195055133.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While we have established that digital media has overtaken the use of television nowadays, <strong>Professor George Gerbner (1919-2005)</strong> in 1994 researched the impact of television on culture and society. He established that it is more than a means of reinforcing behavior but more a means of transmitting culture across the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since its popularity in the 1950s, the way television is being consumed has changed over time. Oral histories and written communications were traditionally the primary means to pass on the culture from generation to generation, but television (and now other forms of audiovisual digital forms) have since taken over that task.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Gerbner, the TV’s task of passing on our history and the stories we value was filtered through the lenses of corporations looking to sell an idea or an image. Because of this, it has become possible that parts of our history, especially those relating to non-dominant groups will be omitted and lost simply because they may not make “good” television.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) established in 1968 regulates broadcasting and telecommunications activities in the country. One of its best-known policies is the Canadian content rules which means that programs of Canadian origins must represent at least 60 percent of Canadian yearly programming and at least 50 percent of primetime programming from 6:00 pm to midnight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reality however is that many Canadians choose to watch American television networks where shows become household names on both sides of the border but most Canadian shows remain unknown outside Canada. The same is true for Canadian films which pale in comparison to Hollywood films in terms of budget and marketing exposure. Hence, showcasing our uniquely Canadian culture does not get as much exposure as the mainstream American culture.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">The Influence of Media Figures</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">We learned from Antonio Gramsci’s cultural hegemony in Chapter 3, where society is dominated by a ruling class that sets standards and norms for others to follow. The media with its many forms is perceived to transmit such standards and norms through the media figures - movie stars, musicians, athletes, and other television personalities that dominate the airwaves. They effectively send us messages about many things including how to act, what we should want, what to buy, and what changes we need to make in ourselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The teens of today focus their attention on media influencers which could produce positive changes in their behaviour and at the same time could also negatively affect them. The negative actions presented by an influential media figure may be internalized in the same way by teenagers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Albert Bandura and Learning Through Observation</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space-collapse: preserve;"><span style="border: none;"><img height="215" width="164" src="image_21331053431708977048690_20240226195055102.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A well-known psychologist who studied learned behavior is <strong>Albert Bandura (1925-)</strong>. He believed that people learn through observing other people’s behavior and then modeling it. This learned behavior then serves as a template for how to behave in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bandura made an engaging experiment where an adult and a child were put in a room filled with interesting toys. The experiment went like this:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">With the child in the room, the adult would play with the toys for a minute and then would turn aggressive toward the inflatable Bobo doll - kicking, punching, and hitting it with a hammer.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The child subject was brought into another room filled with toys but was not permitted to play with them, which was intended to increase the child’s interest and frustration;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Then the child was taken to another room with aggressive and non-aggressive toys and allowed to play with a few of them including a Bobo doll.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>Bandura concluded that children who were exposed to the aggressive model were more likely to imitate the aggressive behavior toward the Bobo doll than those who did not witness the adult aggressive behavior beforehand. He also found that girls are less likely to be prone to physical violence but equally likely to engage in verbal aggression.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This second finding parallels the forms of bullying displayed by the young generation. Bullying from males tends to be more physical while female bullies tend to do it through social and verbal forms. The experiment showed that children modelled aggressive behaviour which they apply to new situations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;So bullying can occur as a result of children trying the aggressive learned behaviors in new situations. With all the many long-term solutions schools make to break the cycle of bullying and reduce stress and anxiety in children, one possible solution is for them to have positive behaviors to model.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Violence in Media</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the more notable changes in our recent history is the saturation of our culture and daily lives by the mass media. The proliferation of many forms of media sources, i.e., television, movies, and video games makes it enormously hard for parents to prevent their children from being exposed to violent content. Children’s exposure to violence in the media increases the risk of them imitating violent behaviors growing up.&amp;nbsp; Media violence is the portrayal of aggressive actions from one human or human-like character against another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2020, people spend an average of 144 minutes per day (two hours and forty-four minutes) on social media an increase of one hour a day from 2012. Whether we like it or not, social media is now an inherent part of our lives and it is unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Read this <a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> for additional information.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most recent data on time spent watching television in Canada in the 2019/20 broadcast year was 25 hours a week among adults 18 years and over. Teenagers, however, spend half of that since they are mostly glued to their cellphones, laptops, and other gadgets watching digital shows. One can just imagine how many acts of violence - murder, kidnapping, torture - children are exposed to before they even turn 18.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even more concerning is the advent of video games and their potential impact on the players’ behaviors. Here, the player is an active participant in the graphic portrayal of the violent world, rather than as a mere viewer.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The players commit violent acts themselves through the actions of their virtual characters, and many of them possess a strong will to complete their goals at all costs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>The addictive effects of these games are shown by the number of hours players stay on the games. Addiction to video games is not uncommon among teenagers and it poses a real problem that affects millions of gamers all over the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A good question to pose is what happens when one participates in this violent behavior, albeit virtually, for hours each day? It has the potential to not only create the foundation for desensitization to violence but also to influence the behaviors of the people playing these games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The proliferation of violence and even sexual content in the media has a desensitizing effect on the part of the viewers, especially among children’s young minds. Constant exposure to these types of content may desensitize them whereas for some, watching may no longer arouse anxiety or fear but may even become an enjoyable experience. Desensitization to violent acts results in the normalization of violence through popular media. Normalization is the process by which a social phenomenon becomes accepted as being “normal” or common and part of the mainstream beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A study conducted by the American National Institute of Mental Health identified three major effects on children when they see violence on television. Though it has been 39 years since that study came out (1982), the brief and concise summary it provided on the effects of violence on media remains highly relevant among today’s children:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Children may become less sensitive to the pain and sufferings of others;</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Children may become fearful of the world around them; and</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Children may be more likely to behave in aggressive or harmful ways toward others.</li>
