<h2 class="card-title">Employment Trends</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work in its most basic form is necessary for people to survive. It has become intrinsic in modern society as it has become a way to define social status and an integral part of a person’s identity. A person who works contributes to the well-being of society. Social scientists see the importance of studying employment trends to understand how society changes over time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not uncommon in Canada or North America for teenagers to do paid work once they reach a certain age. Most of them, however, work in low-paying service, clerical or sales jobs. Hence, they become prone to exploitation by working longer hours or doing more dangerous tasks. Working while studying presents other negative impacts like not being able to concentrate on school matters either due to lack of rest and/or sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the risks and disadvantages associated with youth employment, there is indeed a value attached to it by society. Working at a young age gives them the advantage of learning the discipline of paid work and its benefits. It is said to be one of the essential bridges to adulthood. It gives the young people a sense of self-worth and dignity by being financially independent and being a productive member of society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Canada, child welfare and employment legislation is the responsibility of the provincial government.&nbsp; Each province makes its legislation according to its priorities, standards, and coverages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The federal government only sets standards for the federally regulated industries (e.g., banking, shipping, public service, railways) through the Canada Labour Standards Regulation which ensures that persons under 17 years of age may be employed provided that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“They are not required by provincial law to attend school; the work is not likely to endanger their health or safety. They are not required to work underground in a mine or employment prohibited for young workers under the Explosives Regulations, the Nuclear Safety and Control Act and Regulations, or the Canada Shipping Act; and they are not required to work between 11 p.m. on one day and 6 a.m. on the following day.”&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the many challenges faced by young people today is unemployment. In 2016, Canada faced an overall unemployment rate of 7%. This rate has stayed around; this level since 2013. Among the youth population (aged 15-24), unemployment was high at 13.1%, or almost double that of the national data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the recession, this age group appears to suffer the most when it comes to finding employment. Not only are young people competing for jobs against their peers, but they are also facing competition with those who lost their jobs during the process, who have significantly more work experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Migration is a phenomenon that has become an option for the younger generation. The 20-30 age cohort is more likely to migrate for work than those aged 40-50. Unemployment is; a primary motivation for inter-provincial migration.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>George Herbert Mead, (1863-1931)</strong> an American sociologist theorized about how people view and present themselves in social situations. Defining the mind through a set of mental processes, Mead said people observe how others act and then they react according to what they observe. He showed the difference between the “social self” (Me) and the “true self” (I).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The “Me” or the social self is an accumulated understanding of what people think of the individual. The “I” or the true self is the individual’s impulses and the response to “Me” which consists of the attitudes of other people. In the middle is the “mind” where the reflective process between the “I” and “Me” happens. “Me” cannot exist without “I.” But the “I” needs experiences to shape it. The subject (“I”) must exist within society first before reflection can occur because feedback is necessary to make decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space-collapse: preserve;"><span style="border: 3pt solid rgb(255, 255, 255);"><img height="286" width="250" src="image_22948103221708898980540_20240225220943750.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>American sociologist Charles Cooley’s (1864-1929</strong>) theory can be applied to the idea that employment helps define a person. He proposed a theory that explains how identity and personality were created through social interaction which he called the looking-glass self.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cooley offered three components of this concept: 1) we envision how we appear to others; 2) we envision the judgment of that appearance; and 3) our sense of self develops through this interaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Social interaction is at the center of this theory. Behavior is learned when other people provide feedback; we take our social cues from the reaction of others and then create the person that we are.&nbsp; In Cooley’s words, “I am not what I think I am and I am not what you think I am, I am what I think that you think I am.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The textbook provides a good example of this theory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A man loses his job and decides to stay at home and take care of the kids.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>When meeting people the man explains his situation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- the reaction he gets from others helps him gauge how to act and what other people expect, and then he modifies his behavior to meet social expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- the man may seek to find a steady income to meet the social expectation that he should work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;The behavior change may not happen after one encounter but as the information is internalized, changes may occur over time.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Credit and Debt</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Expressed as a percentage, the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is measured by dividing the total monthly recurring debt payment by the monthly gross income. This ratio is believed to give a good measure of how people successfully manage their debts. For Canadians, a rising debt level is troubling debt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A recent article published in June 2020 states that the COVID-19 pandemic has taken hold of the economy where Statistics Canada reported that the ratio of debt to income households has risen to 176.9% from 150% in 2011. It means that for every dollar of after-tax income, the average Canadian family now owes $1.77. Debt comes from a variety of sources including mortgage debt, lines of credit, credit cards, student loans, car loans, and even other material loans (cell phones, computers). Statistics Canada found a trend that lower-income households tended to have a higher debt-to-disposable income ratio.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Read this <span style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Lato, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space-collapse: preserve;"><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/statistics-canada-debt-1.5609510#:~:text=Canadians%20now%20owe%20$1.77%20for,Currently%20it's%20at%20177%.">article</a></span>&nbsp;for additional information.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Borrowing money does have its advantages. It allows people to live more comfortably and can act as a buffer following a temporary loss of income. Among its disadvantages are, that it can make households vulnerable to a host of problems (financial, health, mental stress) and creates risks in the financial system as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is at the age range of 31-35 when debt levels usually peak then it reduces by age as debt responsibilities are paid off (e.g., mortgage). Older Canadians tend to have debt from mortgages or lines of credit while younger Canadians are more likely to have student and credit card loans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are negative implications for young Canadians starting with so much debt. Entry-level wages may not be enough to support living expenses and debt repayments. This may mean that major life decisions may be delayed such as getting married, having children, or owning a home.</p>
