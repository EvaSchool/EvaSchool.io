<p>Money is the key for economic systems worldwide to function. To gain access to more money, people often seek training so they can get higher-paying jobs, but access to this training is limited to people who have the means to pay for it.</p>
<p>When fewer jobs are available, they become more difficult to obtain, therefore employers can demand more from the people applying for work.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Income Disparity</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The gap between those people who “have” and those who “have not” is perpetually growing every year. It was described in 2011 that the top ten percent of Canadian income earners earned ten times as much as the bottom ten percent of Canadian earners.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The people earning the highest salaries receive a disproportionate amount of money, while the common worker sees no change, no increase or decrease, in real wages. When the disparity between the two becomes too great, buying power is affected - it decreases for lower wage earners and increases for the few who earn the highest salaries.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The two major factors contributing to the difference in wages are technology and globalization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Information technology has eliminated many middle-level jobs such as filing and administration.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Globalization has allowed companies to move high-paying manufacturing jobs to countries that pay lower wages to their workers, making company profits higher and costs lower.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Workers now compete on a global level and the top workers in a given field can demand higher wages for their work because it is now being sold on a global market.&nbsp; At the other end of the earning spectrum, workers are experiencing a weakening of their income because they face the threat of having their work outsourced to workers who will accept lower wages.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">These working conditions go back to the Marxist view of the bourgeoisie controlling the means of production and maintaining the exploited and powerless working class because they are too afraid to lose their jobs by complaining about pay discrepancies.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Literacy</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Literacy, which is the ability to read and write, is closely linked to poverty. An individual possessing basic literacy skills has greater access to higher education and higher-paying employment. At the national level, a population with adequate literacy skills is necessary to compete in the global labor market.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canada is facing a literacy crisis when nearly half of its population has below-standard literacy skills. They mostly belong to the seniors group and the new migrants.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">To address the issue, Canadian schools and school boards are making great efforts to focus on literacy as one of the key pillars of education. They focus on a strong foundation for learning before focusing on specific content. It is built on the idea that once the foundation has been created, other learning can be built upon it.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">At the international level, literacy affects overall income as well. A country’s gross domestic product (GDP) is the total dollar value of all goods and services produced in a country over a specific period. It is typically used to measure the health of a country’s economy. A higher GDP is directly correlated with a higher literacy rate.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the higher economic benefits literacy provides, a literate population has other advantages as well. To individuals, it brings a sense of self-confidence and empowers learners to take individual and collective action in their households, workplaces, and the greater community.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It also gives self-reliance and control over everyday situations. People become more politically active and ethnic equality rates become higher as they become more educated and literate. Other benefits of having a literate society include the cultural transmission and transformation of social values and positive attitudes toward the role of women, family planning, and healthy lifestyles.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Employment and Education</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Aside from the pay differences workers face, Canada is also focused on a knowledge-based economy. Therefore to qualify to work in this economy, additional training in a post-secondary institution is necessary. Paying for this is expensive.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The average university tuition in 2020 is $6,500. Foreign students face even higher costs to attend post-secondary institutions, which is as much as three times the national average for Canadian students. For professional programs such as medicine and law, tuition fees can reach as high as $40,000 per year.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">These growing costs limit the number of students who can afford to learn the skills needed to enter higher-paying professions. It all the more increases the divide between the “haves” and the “have-nots.” The level of education a person has is closely related to the income that person earns, this is true in Canada as well as in other parts of the world.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Poverty: A Social Problem or a Money Problem?</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is a social problem if there is no adequate social support in place to help people in need. It is a money problem when social structures may exist but are not properly funded. Addressing the problem of poverty is central to facilitating long-term change in society. Facing this challenge is difficult because poverty has no single cause.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Aside from significant human costs, poverty has a monetary value attached to it. The cost of poverty in Ontario is conservatively estimated at $27 to $33 billion per year <a href="https://feedontario.ca/cost-of-poverty-2019/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(https://feedontario.ca/cost-of-poverty-2019/)</a>. Arriving at this cost means calculating the usage of the health care system, increased crime, lost income, and lost tax revenue.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Early intervention programs for low-income families such as affordable child care, increased skills training, and recognition of the current credentials of new Canadians are all strategies proven to have a significant beneficial impact on the health and social welfare of low-income wage earners.</li>

<h2 class="card-title">Fighting Poverty on a Global Scale</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Money is the name of the game in the fight against poverty. The World Bank was created in 1944 to help meet the needs of developing countries by providing technical assistance and financial aid. It has an overall goal of helping poor countries develop sustainable economies.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br><strong>The Bank has two separate entities or arms that focus on different&nbsp; economic needs of countries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The first is the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) which works to reduce poverty in middle-income and credit-worthy disadvantaged countries.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The second arm is the International Development Association (IDA) which specifically focuses on the world’s poorest countries. Low- or no-interest loans and grants are used to stimulate countries requiring assistance.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Child poverty. - </strong>Worldwide, 1 billion children, or 1 in 2 live in poverty, and 640 million of them live without adequate shelter and about 400 million have no access to safe water. Countries in the global arena are judged based on their ability to serve and protect their populations, particularly their most vulnerable members. In 2000, Canada once again focused on the goal of reducing child poverty to create healthier individuals and encourage prosperity for future generations. Achieving this goal is not easy.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>An Act to Eliminate Child Poverty was passed to identify key roles for all levels of government to recognize how to achieve this goal. Some of the strategies include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A public system of high-quality childhood education.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Affordable child care services.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Higher tax benefits for low-income families.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Increased Federal Work Tax credits of $2400 per year.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A poverty education strategy developed with First Nations and urban Aboriginal communities.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Federal funding for post-secondary opportunities for students on a needs-based system.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Proactive strategies include equity in the public and private sectors to level the playing field for groups of historically disadvantaged individuals (Family Service Toronto, 2011).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Fixing this problem requires a long-term strategy for a successful and healthy nation. Canada released the report</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Opportunity for All: Canada’s First Poverty Reduction Strategy on August 21, 2018. It has a bold vision to build a</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canada where every Canadian has a real and fair chance at success. It targets to reduce poverty by 20% in 2020 and by 50% by 2030.</li>
