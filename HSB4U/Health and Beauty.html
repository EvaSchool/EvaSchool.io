<p>Social scientists are interested in how culture values and approaches different aspects of health. The health care system is created and shaped by social structures and processes.</p>
<p>It is also influenced by the beliefs, attitudes, and opinions of individuals in a society. The idea of beauty may also be examined in the same way as health. Different cultures define beauty differently. How does Canadian culture define beauty?</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Promoting Healthy Behaviors&nbsp;</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Health used to be defined as the absence of disease, but today’s idea of health takes a much broader approach. Focus has shifted from curative to preventive and health promotion - or the idea that people must adopt healthy lifestyles to reduce the likelihood of becoming sick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obesity has become a problem even among younger Canadians. To combat this disease, health is being promoted to increase awareness of the importance of nutrition, healthy eating, and physical activity. Changing people’s behaviors and mindsets is being encouraged through media campaigns, public awareness, and public wellness programs. Childhood obesity makes a person more vulnerable to the early development of serious health conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Reducing Harmful Behaviors</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the other end of promoting healthy behaviors is that of reducing harmful behaviors. Number one on the list is smoking. The federal and provincial governments have intensified their media campaigns on reducing the rates of smoking among Canadians by highlighting its health risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They have enacted laws establishing smoke-free areas, particularly in public buildings - schools, hospitals, offices, restaurants. The approach of increasing knowledge and awareness of risks in combination with changing social structures such as laws has proven to be effective in changing attitudes, perceptions, and social norms.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Barriers to Health Care</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Canada has a universal healthcare system which is delivered publicly through the provincial and territorial governments.&amp;nbsp; It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act enacted in 1984. Canadian citizens and permanent residents do not pay for most healthcare services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The universal healthcare system is paid for mostly through taxes, but charitable contributions also play a considerable role. While it is paid for publicly, it is delivered privately. Canadians can and may choose their health providers and the government reimburses the latter for services rendered for agreed-upon fees.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space-collapse: preserve;"><span style="border: none;"><img height="229" width="206" src="image_47793623921708981193505_20240226210000938.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>Canada’s healthcare system is a model of universal health coverage and one of the best in the world, but it is far from perfect. Its comprehensive services include but are not limited to professional fees (general practitioners and specialists), hospital stays and medication, emergency services, surgeries, maternity services, laboratory services, and various medical procedures. What is not included are dental and vision health and prescription drugs.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Read this <a href="https://www.ephpp.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> for additional resources.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One major barrier to Canadian health care is cost. Unless supplemented by private health insurance to cover non-medical services (dental and vision) and prescription drugs for chronic illnesses, people pay out of their pocket. Some examples of chronic conditions are diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, and arthritis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In Canada, the majority of people with these illnesses belong to below-average household incomes, making it difficult for them to afford certain types of medications. Other secondary costs to consider are health care such as transportation costs incurred in going to appointments, cost of child care, and lost wages from time away from work to go to doctor’s appointments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many individuals in Canada are covered by private insurance providers through their employment benefit plans, which cover extended dental and medical needs. Admittedly though, many employers and self-employed individuals still are not able to afford private insurance premiums, so this lack of private insurance coverage prevents them from availing health-related services they badly need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Geography can be considered as another barrier to health care. Canada is the second largest country in the world in terms of land area. Hence, people living in rural areas have more limited access to health services than those living in metropolitan cities where a good public transportation network is available.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recruiting and retaining health professionals in the rural areas is hard. They, just like those in other professions tend to find employment in the cities, despite incentives for doctors to stay in the rural areas. This all the more contributes to the rural population being underserved as far as health care is concerned.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Culture and Beauty</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Different cultures have different definitions of beauty. What people consider to be beautiful today may not be true in the past. One thing though is common. People, especially women, would go to extreme lengths just to look “beautiful” in the eyes of others, especially men, even if they suffer physical pain in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Different periods allowed themselves to go through, just to adhere to the standard of what is beautiful.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The 10-cm lotus feet -</strong> In ancient China, having small feet was a sign of perfect beauty so women bound their feet to make them smaller which was ultimately done for male sexual satisfaction. This caused the women severe pain, imbalance, and eventually osteoporosis.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Quicksand, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); white-space-collapse: preserve;"><span style="border: none;"><img height="203" width="153" src="image_49856511931708981193631_20240226210000920.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>High forehead - </strong>during the Elizabethan era, a woman with a high forehead was considered beautiful. Women did this by plucking their hair and covering their skin with lead-based paints.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wearing corsets -</strong> During the 14th to 19th centuries, corsets were popular among women. It makes them maintain an upright posture and a slender waist which was perceived as social evidence of discipline, modesty, rigor, and refinement. Making them tightly bound around the torso, these women suffered from shallow breathing and restricted veins.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Beauty and Identity</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p style="text-align: justify;">What defines a person’s identity? Self-identity reflects how individuals view themselves and comes from many factors. As we learned in Chapter 1, Neo-Freudian psychologist Erik Erikson maintained the continuous development of personality and behavior throughout the life cycle. Remember, this theory of Erikson was in contrast to Freud’s&amp;nbsp; belief that much of psychosocial development happens during the first five years of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Erikson, each stage of a person's life poses a challenge and a crisis for the individual to face and overcome. Adolescents go through the process of identity confusion or crisis where they try to explore who they are and have an increased concern about how others view them. It is at this stage that various factors such as family, peers, and popular media influence whether or not a teenager will form a positive self-identity or become confused about who they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adolescence is also the stage when people become vulnerable to outside influences on body image. An ideal body image that is socially acceptable is portrayed by the media, but oftentimes, it is far from reality and most women cannot ever achieve it. Tall, thin, sexy, white-skinned women are the standards of an ideal body image. If one’s body does not match any of these standards, teenage girls become dissatisfied with their bodies which leads to confusion, frustration, and even depression.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Social media has also created an ideal body image for males such as becoming more muscular in the right places - defined biceps and pectoral muscles as well as chiseled abdominal muscles or the “6-pack.” Males and females share the same psychological motivations and like girls, young men also develop eating disorders, low self-esteem, and inability to cope with social issues.</p>
