    <h2>MCR3U, Functions</h2>

    <p><strong>Welcome to MCR3U!</strong></p>
    <p>
      This course introduces students to the mathematical concept of a function and the ways in which functions can be represented. Students will investigate and apply properties of polynomial, exponential, and trigonometric functions, represent functions in multiple ways, and solve equations graphically and algebraically. Emphasis will be placed on developing algebraic skills and using functions to model real-life situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of this course, students will have a solid foundation in function concepts that will prepare them for further studies in MHF4U and other university-level mathematics courses.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> MPM2D (Principles of Mathematics, Grade 10 Academic)</p>

    <p>
      This course is designed with you—the student—in mind. Instead of relying on memorization, you will be encouraged to
      <em>understand patterns, explore relationships, and think deeply</em> about how math connects to the real world. Developing strong reasoning skills and becoming a confident problem-solver will be essential to your success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take your time with each topic, work through the examples carefully, and don’t be afraid to try new problem-solving strategies. Mistakes are part of the learning process—use them to your advantage and keep improving.
