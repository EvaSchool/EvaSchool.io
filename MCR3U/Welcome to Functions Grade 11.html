<h1 class="col-12 offset-md-1 col-md-10 offset-lg-2 col-lg-8">Welcome to Functions – Grade 11 (MCR3U)</h1>

<p class="col-12 offset-md-1 col-md-10 offset-lg-2 col-lg-8">
This course introduces students to the mathematical concept of the function by extending their experiences with linear and quadratic relations. Students will investigate properties of discrete and continuous functions, represent functions numerically, algebraically, and graphically, and solve problems involving applications of functions. 
</p>

<p class="col-12 offset-md-1 col-md-10 offset-lg-2 col-lg-8">
Students will also develop an understanding of rates of change, explore transformations of functions, and build the algebraic skills necessary for future success in courses such as Advanced Functions (MHF4U) and Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U).
