<p class="col-12 offset-md-1 col-md-10 offset-lg-2 col-lg-8">
This course enables students to deepen their understanding of chemistry through the study of organic chemistry, atomic and molecular structure, energy changes and rates of reaction, chemical systems and equilibrium, and electrochemistry. Students will further develop problem-solving and laboratory skills as they investigate chemical processes, and will enhance their ability to communicate scientific information.
</p>

<p class="col-12 offset-md-1 col-md-10 offset-lg-2 col-lg-8">
This course prepares students for university programs in science, health, and engineering. It emphasizes inquiry-based learning and critical thinking in both theoretical and practical contexts.
