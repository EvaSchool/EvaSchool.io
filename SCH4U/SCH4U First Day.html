    <h2>SCH4U, Chemistry</h2>

    <p><strong>Welcome to SCH4U!</strong></p>
    <p>
      This course enables students to deepen their understanding of chemistry through the study of organic chemistry, energy changes and rates of reaction, chemical systems and equilibrium, electrochemistry, and atomic and molecular structure. Students will further develop problem-solving and laboratory skills as they investigate chemical processes, and will refine their ability to communicate scientific information.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of this course, students will have gained the conceptual and practical skills needed for university-level science programs, and a greater appreciation for the role of chemistry in the natural and technological world.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> SCH3U (Grade 11 Chemistry, University Preparation)</p>

    <p>
      This course has been developed with a focus on inquiry, critical thinking, and scientific investigation. You are encouraged to approach each unit with curiosity, ask thoughtful questions, and engage fully with lab activities and discussions. Success in chemistry comes from practice, precision, and persistence—embrace mistakes as opportunities to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we move through the course, remember that chemistry is not just a subject in a textbook—it is happening all around us, in every reaction, every material, and every change we observe.
