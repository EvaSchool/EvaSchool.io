<h1>Government Policy, Families, and the Impact of Residential Schools</h1>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Residential schools in Canada</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Residential schools in Canada, formerly termed Indian residential schools, represent a dark chapter in the country's history, marked by the systematic cultural assimilation and abuse of Indigenous children. These schools were part of a government-sponsored initiative, primarily from the late 19th century to the latter half of the 20th century, to assimilate Indigenous peoples into Euro-Canadian culture.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The establishment of residential schools in Canada can be traced back to the 1870s when the federal government partnered with various Christian denominations to run these institutions. The idea was to assimilate Indigenous children into European culture, eradicate Indigenous languages, traditions, and spiritual practices, and accelerate their integration into mainstream Canadian society.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade  " data-itemprop="1|1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Residential schools were typically run by churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican Church, United Church of Canada, and others, in collaboration with the Canadian government. The schools were often located far from Indigenous communities, making it difficult for families to maintain regular contact with their children.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade  " data-itemprop="2|1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The effects of residential schools were devastating on Indigenous communities. Children were forcibly removed from their families and subjected to harsh discipline, physical and emotional abuse, neglect, and inadequate living conditions. The schools aimed to strip Indigenous children of their cultural identity, resulting in a loss of language, traditions, and spiritual practices for many survivors.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade  " data-itemprop="3|1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Numerous reports have documented widespread physical, sexual, and emotional abuse suffered by the students in these schools. Many survivors have shared their traumatic experiences, shedding light on the long-lasting impact on mental health and well-being. The abuse within these institutions has had intergenerational effects, affecting not only the survivors but also their families and communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade  " data-itemprop="4|1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">In recognition of the historical wrongs committed through residential schools, the Canadian government officially apologized in 2008. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was subsequently established to uncover the truth about what happened in these schools, promote healing, and recommend actions for reconciliation. The TRC documented the experiences of survivors and provided a platform for them to share their stories.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade  " data-itemprop="5|1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The TRC issued 94 Calls to Action, addressing various aspects of Canadian society, including education, health, justice, and language, to foster reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. Implementation of these recommendations is an ongoing process, and progress is being monitored to address the historical and contemporary injustices faced by Indigenous communities.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade  " data-itemprop="6|1">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The legacy of residential schools continues to affect Indigenous communities today. Healing and reconciliation efforts involve acknowledging the trauma, preserving and revitalizing Indigenous cultures, and promoting understanding and respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians. Education and awareness play a crucial role in this process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, the history of residential schools in Canada is a painful and significant part of the country's past. Acknowledging this history, learning from it, and actively working towards reconciliation are essential steps in building a more just and inclusive society in Canada.</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">Indigenous children were sent to residential schools funded by the Canadian government and often run by churches. The goal was to try to make Indigenous children more like children in mainstream society.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Canadian residential schools were in operation from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s. Although most schools were closed by 1960, the last Canadian residential school closed in Saskatchewan in 1998.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1958, when he was a six-year-old boy, <strong>Marcel Petiquay</strong>’<strong>s mother</strong> lovingly packed a small brown suitcase for him to take with him on his leave to a Canadian residential school. In 2007, recalling that suitcase, he wrote the following poem:</p>

<p>The first time I left for residential school,<br>my mother carefully prepared my<br>little suitcase. She took care to put in it everything<br>I would need. My clothes, some<br>toys I would never see again.&nbsp;<br>I was six years old on this first trip.</p>
<p>In my little suitcase, my mother had also put<br>all the love she had, without forgetting&nbsp;<br>the love from my father.<br>There were also embraces,<br>tenderness, respect, for me<br>and others, sharing, and many<br>other qualities she had taught me.</p>

<p>They had been replaced by hatred,&nbsp;<br>self-rejection, abuses of all<br>kinds (alcohol, drugs, sexual abuse),&nbsp;<br>violence, anger, and suicidal thoughts.<br>That is what I carried for<br>a long time, but &nbsp;I've been&nbsp;<br>cleaning out this suitcase.</p>
