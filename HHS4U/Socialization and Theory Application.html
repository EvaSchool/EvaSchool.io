<h4>Lesson Description</h4>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this lesson, students will explore family socialization, assess theoretical perspectives on family and parent-child relationships, and analyze caregiving's impact on family dynamics. They'll also examine how caregiving is managed in diverse family types, study the family's role in socialization across cultures and history, compare children's roles in family and society, and assess recent demographic trends in parent-child relationships. This lesson equips students with a thorough understanding of family dynamics and their impact on the development of individuals.</p>

<h4>Specific Expectations</h4>
</div>
<p>B3.1&nbsp;Describe the functions of the family<br>(e.g., reproduction, socialization of children, physical maintenance of members, nurturance and love, social control, production of goods and services), and explain the ways in which these functions are met in diverse family forms (e.g., single-parent families, two-parent families [both same-sex and heterosexual], grandparent-led families, extended families, childless families).</p>
<p>B3.2&nbsp;Assess various theoretical perspectives on the development of family and parent-child relationships (e.g., psychodynamic, symbolic interactionist, structural functionalist, conflict theory, social exchange theory perspectives).</p>
<p>B3.3 Assess, with reference to current theories and research (e.g., caregiver identity theory, child and adult attachment theories, Roy Adaptation Model<br>of Caregiver Stress), the impact of caregiving on family relationships.</p>
<p>C3.2 Analyse the ways in which caregiving responsibilities are carried out (e.g., with reference to the sex of caregivers; whether caregiving is paid work; the extent to which children, grandparents,<br>or other relatives are involved in providing care) in<br>diverse families (e.g., working-class and upper- middle-class families, single-parent and extended families, grandparent-led families).</p>
<p>C3.4 Analyse the role of the family as an agent of socialization in different cultures and historical periods and among groups from various religious backgrounds (e.g., with reference to child- rearing practices, parental expectations, attitudes towards sexuality, education, gender socialization).</p>
<p>C3.5 Compare the roles of children in the family and society in various cultures and historical periods (e.g., with reference to rites of passage, participation in education and the labour force, the nature of parent-child relationships, attitudes towards family members with special needs).</p>
<p>C3.6 Analyse the impact of social institutions (e.g., educational, religious, economic, and political institutions) on the socialization of family members.</p>
<p>D3.2 Analyse the significance of recent demographic trends relating to parent-child relationships (e.g., with reference to family forms, birth rates, age at childbearing, child custody arrangements, caregiving responsibilities, life expectancy, employment status of family members, educational attainment).</p>
