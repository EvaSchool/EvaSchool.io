<p>A pendulum is an isolated object—consider instead particles that are part of a material, like a drumhead. If the particles in the drumhead are disturbed, such as when you beat the drum, the vibrations created by the disturbance are transferred throughout the material. This transfer of energy through a material by particle vibration is called a mechanical wave. The material through which a mechanical wave travels is called a medium. A medium can be a solid, a liquid, or a gas.</p>
<p>When vibrating, the medium tends to gain or lose very little energy. Thus, a vibration can continue for a long time in some media.</p>

<p>It is the net motion of the particles that causes a vibration. Net motion is the displacement of a particle over a certain time interval. The particle may follow a complex path, but the particle’s net motion is how far it has moved (straight-line distance) from its starting point to its finishing point. After a wave has passed through a medium, the particles return to their original location.</p>
<p>We know that molecules are always in motion because of thermal energy. However, thermal motion—motion resulting from thermal energy—is random and does not produce a transfer of energy in the form of a mechanical wave. Instead, the medium has to be disturbed by a vibration to set up a mechanical wave.</p>

<p>All vibrations need a medium to transfer waves. A medium’s effectiveness at transmitting vibrations varies, depending on its molecular and mechanical structure, its density, and even its temperature.</p>

<h2>Particle Behaviour in Solid Media</h2>
<p>Suppose you sit at one end of a mattress, and at the other end you place some objects such as textbooks. What do you think will happen if you bounce on one end of the mattress?</p>
<p>If you bounce on one end of the mattress, the objects at the other end will move. This is because the material in the mattress is connected, so a disturbance at one end is transferred to the other end. In a solid medium, the atoms are held securely in a crystal formation by strong intermolecular forces. Therefore, they can only vibrate slightly as the disturbance passes through the medium. If the medium returns to its original shape after the disturbance, the medium is said to be elastic.</p>

<p>Elastic the property of a medium that returns to its original shape after being disturbed.</p>
<p>In general, rigid materials transfer mechanical waves more efficiently than less rigid materials. Thus, mechanical waves in rigid materials last longer, go faster, and go farther than they do in less rigid media.</p>

<h2>Particle Behaviour in Fluid Media</h2>
<p>In liquids, the molecules are not in a crystal formation but are still very much in contact. So liquids are very effective transmitters of sound.</p>
<p>Molecules in liquids are not in a crystal formation but are still very much in contact. So liquids are very effective transmitters of sound.</p>
<p>The individual molecules in a gas are much farther apart than they are in liquids and solids. Consequently, gas is the least dense state of matter. Gases rely on translational molecular motion, or straight-line motion, to transfer vibrations.</p>
<p>The straight-line motion of a molecule; this motion is typical of gases because the particles in liquids and solids are not free to move in this manner</p>
<p>With their lower density, gases are less effective than solids and liquids at transmitting vibrations. How well a gas transmits a vibration also depends on the gas’s temperature and density.</p>
