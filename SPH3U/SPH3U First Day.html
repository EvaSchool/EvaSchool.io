  <title>SPH3U – First Day Welcome</title>

  <h2>SPH3U, Physics, Grade 11 University Preparation</h2>

  <h3>Welcome to SPH3U!</h3>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>SPH3U</strong>! This course will help you explore and understand the fundamental principles of physics that govern our universe. You will develop your scientific investigation skills and problem-solving abilities through both theoretical and practical applications. Physics is not only about learning concepts—it’s about developing the ability to think critically, analyze situations, and apply knowledge to solve real-world problems.</p>
  <p>
    In this course, you will study motion, forces, energy, waves, electricity, and magnetism. You will perform experiments, analyze data, and use mathematical models to describe and predict physical phenomena.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Science, Grade 10, Academic (SNC2D).</p>

  <hr>

  <p>
    SPH3U will challenge you to connect physics concepts to technology, engineering, and societal issues. Through hands-on labs, projects, and collaborative learning, you will strengthen your ability to apply scientific reasoning and communicate your findings effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    To succeed in this course, keep up with your readings, complete all assignments on time, and ask questions whenever you need clarification. Physics builds on itself—consistent practice and curiosity are essential.
