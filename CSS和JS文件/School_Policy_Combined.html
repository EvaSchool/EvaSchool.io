<p>1. Assessment &amp; Evaluation Policy</p>
<p>Purpose: The primary purpose of assessment is to improve student learning. Assessment relates directly to the expectations for the course. A variety of assessments for and as learning are conducted on a regular basis to allow ample opportunities for students to improve and ultimately demonstrate their full range of learning, and in order for the teacher to gather information to provide feedback. Assessment tasks relate to the success criteria set out in lesson plans. Success criteria allow students to see what quality looks like.</p>
<p>Evaluation is the process of judging the quality of student work in relation to the achievement chart categories and criteria, and assigning a percentage grade to represent that quality. Evaluation is based on gathering evidence of student achievement through:</p>
<p>Products</p>
<p>Observations</p>
<p>Conversations</p>
<p>2. Grading Policy</p>
<p>The final grade is based on performance in three areas: products, observations, and conversations. 70% of the grade is based on evaluations conducted throughout the course. 30% is based on a final evaluation.</p>
<p>Weighting of Categories</p>
<p>3. Academic Honesty – Plagiarism Policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibition of Plagiarism</li>
<p>Plagiarism occurs when someone presents the work of others as their own. This includes:</p>
<p>Copying large amounts of text from the Internet or other written texts without crediting the original author.</p>
<p>Copying the work of other students, pretending it is their own.</p>
<p>Submitting an assignment from one course in a different course, pretending it to be original work.</p>
<p>Using AI tools (such as ChatGPT or other generative AI applications) to produce content and submitting it as your own work without proper modification, citation, or critical engagement.</p>
<p>Copying and pasting answers, essays, or any substantial portions of work generated by AI tools and presenting them as original work.</p>
<p>Using AI to complete tests, quizzes, or assignments that are intended to assess independent thinking or understanding.</p>
<p>Submitting work that significantly exceeds the student’s usual level of performance and cannot be explained or reproduced upon questioning</p>
<p>All student submissions will be subject to review byTurnitin, to ensure authenticity and proper citation of sources.</p>
<p>Students are expected to understand and take responsibility for the content they submit. Teachers may follow up to verify authorship through interviews, writing samples, or clarification questions. Using AI tools is not inherently dishonest, but students are expected to use them responsibly. AI may be used to support your learning (e.g., grammar checking, idea brainstorming, researching background knowledge), but the final work must reflect your own understanding and voice. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in your work being considered plagiarized, which can lead to academic consequences including a mark of zero, a formal warning, or further disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Many post-secondary institutions require students found guilty of academic dishonesty to withdraw from the course and/or the institution. At Emerald Valley Academy (EVA), we consider academic honesty extremely important. Since our goal is to inspire academic excellence for students, we believe that academic honesty is an important lesson to learn during high school. For this reason, teachers will review correct methods of footnoting sources to help students avoid suspicion of copying from outside sources. Using someone else’s ideas to support your own is not a problem—however, pretending that those ideas are yours is the core issue. Teachers throughout Ontario (and elsewhere) have access to online software that can easily detect plagiarism, so it is important for students to pay careful attention to this issue.</p>
<p>As outlined in Growing Success, students must understand that the tests/exams they complete and the assignments they submit for evaluation must be their own work and that cheating and plagiarism will not be condoned.</p>
<p>Responsibilities of EVA Students:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the teacher asks you to use your own words and ideas, it means you should use your own words and your own ideas.</li>
<ul>
<li>You must demonstrate that you are capable of submitting work that is your own.</li>
<ul>
<li>When a teacher asks you to put your ideas into your own words, there is no single “correct” answer; rather, you are expected to show personal thinking.</li>
<p>Responsibilities of EVA Teachers:</p>
<p>Teachers will help students avoid plagiarism by using strategies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>defining “plagiarism” and reminding students of this policy when introducing an assignment;</li>
<ul>
<li>giving examples of what plagiarism looks like;</li>
<ul>
<li>emphasizing the importance of process skills (e.g., outlining, drafting) in addition to the final product;</li>
<ul>
<li>teaching research skills (note taking, paraphrasing, summarizing) so students can avoid plagiarism;</li>
<ul>
<li>teaching organizational skills (finding and organizing information, building an outline for a report or research essay);</li>
<ul>
<li>having students keep a learning log to reflect on what they learned, how they can improve, etc.;</li>
<ul>
<li>assessing process steps (notes, outline, summary, bibliography, drafts); and</li>
<ul>
<li>informing students of the consequences of plagiarism.</li>
<p>Consequences for Academic Dishonesty at EVA</p>
<ul>
<li>Instance #1: When plagiarism is detected, the teacher will discuss the matter with the student. Both parents and the Principal will be informed, and the student will have an opportunity to redo the assignment without plagiarism.</li>
<ul>
<li>Instance #2: A second offense results in a mark of zero for the assignment. Parents and the Principal will be informed again, and this will be noted in the student’s school records.</li>
<ul>
<li>Instance #3: Repeat instances of plagiarism may result in withdrawal from the course and/or the school without a tuition refund. Similarly, students found cheating on tests or exams will receive a zero on that test/exam, and these details will be noted in their school records.</li>
<p>Appeal:</p>
<p>A student may appeal the teacher’s decision to the Principal after discussing it with the teacher.</p>
<p>4. Course Policy</p>
<p>To ensure academic fairness, program efficiency, and the integrity of our online learning environment, all students must review and consent to the following terms upon enrollment at Emerald Valley Academy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each course must be completed within a minimum of one month and no more than six months from the date of enrollment. If a course is not completed within six months, the student will be required to retake the course from the beginning.</li>
<ul>
<li>Students must remain active in the online learning system.</li>
<ul>
<li>If a student does not log in for more than one week (seven consecutive days), the school will issue and send a Warning Letter every Friday.</li>
<ul>
<li>If a student does not log in for more than two consecutive weeks, the school will inactivate the student’s account. The student must contact the school and provide a written explanation to reactivate the account.</li>
<ul>
<li>To maintain academic integrity, students are required to follow the proctoring instructions and submit a recorded video/photos of their proctored exam/assignments. The Midterm or Final Report Card will only be issued after the videos/photos have been received and reviewed by the school.</li>
<ul>
<li>If a student wishes to withdraw/extend/suspend from a course or the program, the student must complete and sign the official request forms.</li>
<p>5. Policy on Late/Missed Assignments</p>
<p>Students are responsible for providing evidence of their achievement of the overall expectations within the timeframe specified by the teacher and in a format approved by the teacher. There are consequences for not completing assignments for evaluation or for submitting those assignments late.</p>
<p>Late and Missed Assignments
The Ministry of Education’s policy states that “the primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning.” Submitting work late is considered a learning skills and work habits issue and may impact the student’s grade. The Ministry requires teachers to separate evaluation of the curriculum expectations from the development of learning skills and work habits (Responsibility, Organization, Independent Work, Collaboration, Initiative, Self-Regulation).</p>
<p>Students may submit work late for various reasons, and teachers take the time to understand why. Reasons could include:</p>
<p>Legitimate explanation</p>
<p>Poor time management skills</p>
<p>Poor academic skills</p>
<p>Poor understanding of the assignment</p>
<p>Responsibilities of EVA Teachers:</p>
<p>Students should be expected to submit work on time.</p>
<p>The teacher must inform students of the due date of an assignment and the ultimate deadline (the last opportunity for students to submit the assignment). This deadline is set at the teacher’s discretion.</p>
<p>Where appropriate, a number of strategies (see Growing Success, p. 44) may be used to help prevent and/or address late and missed assignments.</p>
<p>Missed Evaluations
Students who do not submit assignments may receive a zero. A mark of zero can result in a gap in the record of achievement of curriculum expectations because the teacher lacks evidence of the student’s knowledge or skills. Students are responsible for providing teachers with the evidence of their learning.</p>
<p>6. Attendance Policy</p>
<p>EVA conducts asynchronous, online courses. Students are free to log in and work on their course material at their own pace. Courses are designed to take 110 hours to complete, and all course assignments, including the final exam, must be completed within 6 months from the start of enrollment.</p>
<p>Regular attendance is critical for student learning and for achievement of course expectations. Where, in the Principal’s judgment, a student’s frequent absences are jeopardizing successful completion of a course, EVA staff will arrange to meet with the student and parents to explain the potential consequences of these absences, including failure to gain credits, and to discuss steps for improvement.</p>
<p>Students are required to log into the course a minimum of three times weekly for the entire duration of their course. Failure to log in regularly may result in the student falling behind on course assignments. Students are often required to collaborate on group work; hence, regular attendance is very important. Failure to meet the minimum login requirement will result in an absence being recorded on midterm and/or final report cards.</p>
<p>7. Truancy Policy</p>
<p>Truancy is defined as an absence from school without an approved excuse, whether it is for part of the day or the entire day. Parents are required by the Education Act (or relevant local requirements) to report the reason for a student’s absence to the EVA administration.</p>
<p>Students must attend school until the age of eighteen (18) or until graduation. Reaching the age of majority does not imply any specific rights regarding attendance. If a student is eighteen (18) or older and chooses not to follow the rules, regulations, and/or policies of EVA, that student can be asked to withdraw from the school.</p>
<p>When, in the Principal’s judgment, a student’s frequent absences are jeopardizing his or her success, EVA staff will meet with the student and the parents to explain the possible consequences and explore steps to improve attendance.</p>
<p>In the case of online learning, students are expected to log in at least three (3) times per week for the entire duration of their course. If a student fails to do so, an absence will be recorded on the midterm and/or final report card. If this happens two (2) consecutive weeks, the student and parents will be contacted for an explanation. If the student continues to be truant, a direct contact (phone call, video meeting, or similar) will be made. If the student fails to attend class for 59 consecutive days, the online account will be suspended and the student may be withdrawn from the course without a tuition refund. All student work will remain intact; any resumption of the online course is at the discretion of the Principal in consultation with the student, teacher, and parents (if applicable).</p>
<p>8. Instructional Approaches</p>
<p>Students at EVA learn through a variety of methods, including:</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>involve students in the use of higher-level thinking skills; and</li>
<ul>
<li>encourage students to look beyond the literal meaning of texts.</li>
<p>9. Program Considerations for English Language Learners</p>
<p>Teachers at EVA will use appropriate strategies for instruction and assessment to support English language learners. Such strategies include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>modification of some or all of the subject expectations, depending on the student’s English proficiency level;</li>
<ul>
<li>use of varied instructional strategies (e.g., visual cues, graphic organizers, scaffolding);</li>
<ul>
<li>previewing of textbooks;</li>
<ul>
<li>pre-teaching key vocabulary;</li>
<ul>
<li>peer tutoring;</li>
<ul>
<li>strategic use of students’ first language;</li>
<ul>
<li>use of diverse learning resources (e.g., visual materials, simplified text, bilingual dictionaries, culturally responsive materials);</li>
<ul>
<li>use of assessment accommodations (e.g., granting extra time); and</li>
<ul>
<li>alternative assessment methods (oral interviews, demonstrations, visual representations, graphic organizers, cloze sentences) instead of purely essay-based tasks.</li>
<p>10. Equity &amp; Inclusion Policy</p>
<p>At Emerald Valley Academy, our mission is to inspire academic excellence for students and strong confidence for parents.</p>
<p>We draw on beliefs similar to those outlined in educational equity and inclusion frameworks—recognizing that each student must be represented and reflected in the learning experiences and environments we provide. EVA celebrates and values unique student interests, backgrounds, cultures, and prior experiences.</p>
<p>We are committed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confronting inequities and barriers that perpetuate racism and other forms of oppression, so learners of all identities are empowered through education that honors their identities and lived experiences.</li>
<ul>
<li>Seeing each learner as curious, capable, and actively involved in their own learning.</li>
<ul>
<li>Empowering all learners to achieve personal excellence by being open, flexible, and responsive to their needs.</li>
<ul>
<li>Fostering a positive, innovative learning environment that promotes authentic relationships locally and globally.</li>
<ul>
<li>Sharing responsibility as a community (families, educators, leaders) to inspire learners to be active, engaged, global citizens.</li>
<p>Through culturally responsive pedagogy and the integration of modern digital tools, EVA aims to provide barrier-free access to information and learning networks, enabling all students to explore passions, share their voices, and consider diverse perspectives.</p>
<p>11. Literacy and Inquiry/Research Skills</p>
<p>EVA emphasizes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using clear, concise communication in the online classroom, including diagrams, charts, tables, and graphs.</li>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring students can interpret and use graphic texts effectively.</li>
<ul>
<li>Developing the ability to locate relevant information from multiple sources (books, newspapers, dictionaries, encyclopedias, interviews, videos, Internet).</li>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing that all sources of information have particular points of view.</li>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the responsibility to evaluate source validity and relevance, and use information appropriately.</li>
<p>12. Digital Citizenship Policy</p>
<p>At EVA, technology is used to enhance learning, access information, and communicate. Students will engage with multimedia resources, databases, Internet sites, digital cameras, and word-processing programs. They will collect, organize, and sort data; write, edit, and present research findings; and use technology to support and communicate their learning.</p>
<p>Technology also connects EVA students with other learners and the global community. Our Digital Citizenship Policy ensures students are aware of issues of Internet privacy, safety, and responsible use—while also making clear the potential for abuse, especially when technology is used to promote hatred.</p>
