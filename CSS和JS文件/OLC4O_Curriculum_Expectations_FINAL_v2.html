<h3>Specific Expectations</h3>
<p>Reading and Responding to Texts</p>
<p>By the end of this course, students will:</p>
<ol>
<li>demonstrate that they have read a variety of student-selected and teacher-selected texts, including informational, narrative, and graphic texts (e.g., by keeping a record in a reading log);*</li>
<li>demonstrate the ability to read indepen- dently for personal, school-related, and career-related purposes (e.g., by writing a response to a text, answering assigned questions about a text, creating a summary of events outlined in a newspaper report, comparing descriptions of apprenticeship programs and writing a covering letter of application to one of the programs);</li>
<li>describe, orally and/or in writing, person- ally relevant texts they have read and their responses to them (e.g., read an excerpt of a selected text to a small group or the whole class; write a response to a text; recommend a text to a peer);</li>
<li>use oral language skills, in English or a ﬁrst language, to support and enhance their reading experiences (e.g., by activating and building on prior knowledge through small-group discussion; by asking questions to gather relevant information before reading or to clarify instructions for reading tasks). Understanding the Forms of Texts By the end of this course, students will: Informational Texts</li>
<li>use knowledge of the organizational structure of information paragraphs to identify the main idea (often in the topic sentence) and supporting details;</li>
<li>use knowledge of the organizational structure of opinion pieces (e.g., editorials, proposals, short essays in magazines or newspapers) to identify opinions, main ideas or arguments, and supporting details;</li>
<li>use knowledge of the organizational structure and features of textbooks to locate main ideas and speciﬁc information (e.g., use table of contents to locate chap- ters; use index to locate speciﬁc informa- tion; use headings, subheadings, and bold and italic type to identify main ideas; use glossaries to ﬁnd deﬁnitions); *During the term, students will read and independently demonstrate for evaluation their understanding of a minimum of two narrative texts, four graphic texts, and ﬁve informational texts selected by the teacher. For further information about these minimum term requirements and about the reading tasks that students must perform as part of the ﬁnal evaluation, see pages 12–13. 21 O N T A R I O  S E C O N D A R Y  S C H O O L  L I T E R A C Y  C O U R S E ,  G R A D E  1 2  ( O L C 4 O )</li>
<li>demonstrate understanding of how the organizational structure of informational texts is related to the audience and the purpose for writing (e.g., by comparing the structure, audience, and purpose in an opinion piece and a report on a similar topic);</li>
<li>use cue words and features of print to understand the organization and relation- ship of ideas in the text (e.g., cue words: ﬁrst, then, next signal a chronological pat- tern; similarly, in contrast signal a compare- and-contrast structure); Narrative Texts</li>
<li>use knowledge of the organizational structure of different types of non-ﬁction narratives (e.g., anecdote, recounting of events, biography, news report) and short ﬁction (e.g., dialogue, short story) to iden- tify sequence of events and main ideas;</li>
<li>use knowledge of narrative structure to identify ways in which ﬁction and non- ﬁction narratives are similar (e.g., both may use chronological order, have a dis- tinct setting, develop a character); Graphic Texts</li>
<li>use knowledge of the organizational structure (e.g., layout, grid pattern) of a variety of graphic texts (e.g., schedules, tables, graphs, maps, labelled diagrams, site maps, websites) to identify the purpose of the text, locate information, and extract pertinent details;</li>
<li>explain how the form of a graphic text helps the reader understand the informa- tion or message (e.g., explain to a partner how a graph helps the reader understand the data; explain why the information in a schedule is displayed in a particular way). Using Reading Strategies to Understand Texts By the end of this course, students will: Before Reading</li>
<li>choose an appropriate approach to reading a text to match the purpose for reading (e.g., scan to locate the relevant section in a text; skim to identify the main point; read closely to clarify one’s obligations in a contract);</li>
<li>use appropriate pre-reading strategies to preview new texts, including: • Informational texts (e.g., scan for text features such as headings and for embedded graphics to make predictions about content); • Narrative texts (e.g., read the title and opening paragraph to make predictions about content); • Graphic texts (e.g., scan for distinguish- ing features of layout, such as a grid pat- tern; design, such as levels of heads; and print, such as headings/labels, to preview the content and identify the purpose of the text);</li>
<li>use appropriate strategies to activate and build on prior knowledge of the content of the informational, narrative, or graphic selections (e.g., brainstorm about a topic); During and After Reading</li>
<li>use appropriate strategies to monitor comprehension when reading informa- tional and narrative texts (e.g., pose ques- tions to check understanding; reread passages to clarify understanding; adjust reading speed to suit the complexity of the text);</li>
<li>use appropriate strategies to track and record ideas and information while reading informational and narrative texts (e.g., use highlighter, note-taking, or a visual orga- nizer to identify key facts, points in an argument, or events in a narrative); 22 T H E  O N T A R I O  C U R R I C U L U M :  E N G L I S H</li>
<li>use appropriate strategies to locate infor- mation in different types of texts, including: • Informational texts (e.g., search for key words from a question about the selec- tion to locate speciﬁc information); • Narrative texts (e.g., reread the first sentence of successive paragraphs to identify the sequence of events and/or transitions in scene or changes in speaker); • Graphic texts (e.g., use a ruler to read along lines in a table; read up from the horizontal axis and across from the ver- tical axis to ﬁnd a point on a graph);</li>
<li>use appropriate strategies to make infer- ences about and interpret different types of texts, including: • Informational texts (e.g., while reading, predict a writer’s intentions, conclu- sions, or biases based on his/her presen- tation of the facts); • Narrative texts (e.g., pose questions about the explanations for people’s actions given in a workplace incident report: “Are the explanations convinc- ing?”,“Do they account for all the facts?”,“How could the incident be resolved?”); • Graphic texts (e.g., compare the sizes of different visual features to identify the elements that are most/least important in an advertisement);</li>
<li>make connections between personal experiences and the content of texts to consolidate and extend understanding of different types of texts, including: • Informational texts (e.g., explain why they agree or disagree with an author’s point of view; explain how they would use the information provided in an informa- tion paragraph in their own lives); • Narrative texts (e.g., compare a decision made by a person in a narrative with the choice they would have made in the same situation); • Graphic texts (e.g., relate information from graphic texts to their own pur- poses for reading and/or to information from other sources – for example, by using a road map to help plan a trip);</li>
<li>demonstrate understanding of a variety of informational, narrative, and graphic texts commonly read in daily life (e.g., recipes, manuals, instructions, invoices, e-mails, encyclopedia entries, pamphlets, news reports, short stories, train schedules, bar graphs) by using and/or responding to them appropriately. Using Strategies to Understand New Words and Expressions and to Build Vocabulary By the end of this course, students will:</li>
<li>use appropriate strategies to discover the meaning of unfamiliar and technical words encountered in their reading (e.g., use print, online, and bilingual dictionaries; use context to determine the meaning of new words; create concept maps using new words; build a bank of sight words to increase reading ﬂuency);</li>
<li>use appropriate strategies to discover the meaning of unfamiliar idiomatic expressions encountered in their reading (e.g.,“read past” an unfamiliar expression to gain a sense of the sentence, then make a guess as to its meaning; use or create dictionaries of phrases and expressions);</li>
<li>use appropriate strategies to expand their vocabulary through reading (e.g., use knowledge of roots, preﬁxes, and suffixes to create new words; contribute to class word walls; create personal dictionaries of new words encountered in their reading). 23 O N T A R I O  S E C O N D A R Y  S C H O O L  L I T E R A C Y  C O U R S E ,  G R A D E  1 2  ( O L C 4 O )</li>

<p>Communication Skills in Their Lives</p>
<p>By the end of this course, students will:</p>
<ol>
<li>describe the communication skills they need to function effectively in a variety of situations at school, at work and in daily life (e.g., the ability to read efficiently, to listen effectively, to speak and write cor- rectly and using an appropriate level of language);</li>
<li>explain how the ability to read, write, listen, and speak effectively can help them to succeed at school, at work, and in their personal lives (e.g., communication skills can help them to conduct research effec- tively, perform well in a job interview, present a point of view clearly, work cooperatively with others). Understanding Their Own Role in the Learning Process By the end of this course, students will:</li>
<li>identify the behaviours and attitudes they need to promote their own learning (e.g., active participation, conﬁdence in their ability to improve, persistence, practice, willingness to reﬂect on their learning process and learn from their mistakes). Understanding the Reading and Writing Processes and the Role of Reading and Writing in Learning By the end of this course, students will:</li>
<li>demonstrate understanding that reading is an active process of thinking and con- structing meaning (e.g., by describing, in a conference with the teacher, how they use strategies before, during, and after reading to determine meaning and extract information);</li>
<li>demonstrate understanding that the pur- pose for reading or the requirements of the reading task inﬂuence their approach to reading a text (e.g., by describing dif- ferent approaches and the purposes for which they can be used – for example, skimming can be used to discover the gist of a narrative; close reading can be used to understand complex instructions);</li>
<li>demonstrate understanding that writing is a process that involves a range of thinking and composing skills (e.g., by describing, in a small-group discussion, how they use strategies before, during, and after writing to explore, organize, and express ideas and to polish ﬁnal copy); 27 O N T A R I O  S E C O N D A R Y  S C H O O L  L I T E R A C Y  C O U R S E ,  G R A D E  1 2  ( O L C 4 O )</li>
<li>demonstrate understanding that their sub- ject, audience, and purpose for writing inﬂuence their choices of form, tone, and level of language (e.g., by accurately describing, in a conference with the teacher, the form, style, and tone of a piece of writing and explaining why they are appropriate to the subject, audience, and purpose for writing);</li>
<li>demonstrate understanding of the role of reading and writing in the learning process (e.g., by describing how they use reading and writing to locate and under- stand information in different subject areas; to generate, explore, and clarify ideas and thinking; to communicate for a variety of purposes; to express themselves; and to reﬂect on and extend their learning). Using the Portfolio to Assess Their Growth in Literacy Skills By the end of this course, students will have compiled a literacy portfolio demonstrating their growth in literacy skills during the course. Each student’s literacy portfolio will contain:</li>
<li>an inventory, with completion dates, of all the texts read and the reading responses produced;</li>

<li>all reading responses and writing selections submitted for evaluation during the course;</li>
<li>all pieces that have been polished (e.g., for presentation and display);</li>
<li>a learning journal documenting the steps taken to monitor their learning during the year (e.g., a written self-assessment of their skills at the beginning of the course; an outline of their goals for achieving the required level of skill in reading and writ- ing; a learning plan; checklists and other types of progress reports; a record of regu- lar student-teacher conferences to review goals and assess progress). In using the portfolio to assess their growth in literacy skills, students will:</li>
<li>for each of the required types of texts read (i.e., informational, narrative, graphic) and forms of writing produced (i.e., summary, information paragraph, opinion piece, news report), decide independently which are their most successful reading responses and pieces of writing and explain brieﬂy, in writing, the reasons for their choice;</li>
<li>review the record of their progress in their learning journal, as well as the reading- response and writing samples produced during the course, in order to describe their growth in reading and writing skills throughout the course (e.g., in a written self-reﬂection).</li>
