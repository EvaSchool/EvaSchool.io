        <h4>Reading and Responding to Texts</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>demonstrate that they have read a variety of student-selected and teacher-selected texts, including informational, narrative, and graphic texts (e.g., by keeping a record in a reading log);*</li>
            <li>demonstrate the ability to read indepen- dently for personal, school-related, and career-related purposes (e.g., by writing a response to a text, answering assigned questions about a text, creating a summary of events outlined in a newspaper report, comparing descriptions of apprenticeship programs and writing a covering letter of application to one of the programs);</li>
            <li>describe, orally and/or in writing, person- ally relevant texts they have read and their responses to them (e.g., read an excerpt of a selected text to a small group or the whole class; write a response to a text; recommend a text to a peer);</li>
            <li>use oral language skills, in English or a ﬁrst language, to support and enhance their reading experiences (e.g., by activating and building on prior knowledge through small-group discussion; by asking questions to gather relevant information before reading or to clarify instructions for reading tasks).</li> 
        </ol>        
        <h4>Understanding the Forms of Texts</h4> 
        <h5>Informational Texts</h5>
            <ol>    
                <li>use knowledge of the organizational structure of information paragraphs to identify the main idea (often in the topic sentence) and supporting details;</li>
                <li>use knowledge of the organizational structure of opinion pieces (e.g., editorials, proposals, short essays in magazines or newspapers) to identify opinions, main ideas or arguments, and supporting details;</li>
                <li>use knowledge of the organizational structure and features of textbooks to locate main ideas and speciﬁc information (e.g., use table of contents to locate chap- ters; use index to locate speciﬁc informa- tion; use headings, subheadings, and bold and italic type to identify main ideas; use glossaries to ﬁnd deﬁnitions); *During the term, students will read and independently demonstrate for evaluation their understanding of a minimum of two narrative texts, four graphic texts, and ﬁve informational texts selected by the teacher.</li>
                <li>demonstrate understanding of how the organizational structure of informational texts is related to the audience and the purpose for writing (e.g., by comparing the structure, audience, and purpose in an opinion piece and a report on a similar topic);</li>
                <li>use cue words and features of print to understand the organization and relation- ship of ideas in the text (e.g., cue words: ﬁrst, then, next signal a chronological pat- tern; similarly, in contrast signal a compare- and-contrast structure);</li>
            </ol>    
        <h5> Narrative Texts</h5>
            <ol> 
                <li>use knowledge of the organizational structure of different types of non-ﬁction narratives (e.g., anecdote, recounting of events, biography, news report) and short ﬁction (e.g., dialogue, short story) to iden- tify sequence of events and main ideas;</li>
                <li>use knowledge of narrative structure to identify ways in which ﬁction and non- ﬁction narratives are similar (e.g., both may use chronological order, have a dis- tinct setting, develop a character);</li>
            </ol>
        <h5> Graphic Texts</h5>
            <ol> 
                <li>use knowledge of the organizational structure (e.g., layout, grid pattern) of a variety of graphic texts (e.g., schedules, tables, graphs, maps, labelled diagrams, site maps, websites) to identify the purpose of the text, locate information, and extract pertinent details;</li>
                <li>explain how the form of a graphic text helps the reader understand the informa- tion or message (e.g., explain to a partner how a graph helps the reader understand the data; explain why the information in a schedule is displayed in a particular way).</li>
            </ol> 
            
        <h4>Using Reading Strategies to Understand Texts</h4>

                        <li>Narrative texts (e.g., read the title and opening paragraph to make predictions about content);  </li>
                        <li>Graphic texts (e.g., scan for distinguish- ing features of layout, such as a grid pat- tern; design, such as levels of heads; and print, such as headings/labels, to preview the content and identify the purpose of the text);</li>
                    </ul> 
                </li>
                <li>use appropriate strategies to activate and build on prior knowledge of the content of the informational, narrative, or graphic selections (e.g., brainstorm about a topic); </li>

                    <li> Narrative texts (e.g., reread the first sentence of successive paragraphs to identify the sequence of events and/or transitions in scene or changes in speaker);</li>
                    <li> Graphic texts (e.g., use a ruler to read along lines in a table; read up from the horizontal axis and across from the ver- tical axis to ﬁnd a point on a graph);</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>use appropriate strategies to make infer- ences about and interpret different types of texts, including: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Informational texts (e.g., while reading, predict a writer’s intentions, conclu- sions, or biases based on his/her presen- tation of the facts);</li>
                    <li>Narrative texts (e.g., pose questions about the explanations for people’s actions given in a workplace incident report: “Are the explanations convinc- ing?”,“Do they account for all the facts?”,“How could the incident be resolved?”); </li>
                    <li>Graphic texts (e.g., compare the sizes of different visual features to identify the elements that are most/least important in an advertisement);</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>make connections between personal experiences and the content of texts to consolidate and extend understanding of different types of texts, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Informational texts (e.g., explain why they agree or disagree with an author’s point of view; explain how they would use the information provided in an informa- tion paragraph in their own lives);</li>
                    <li>Narrative texts (e.g., compare a decision made by a person in a narrative with the choice they would have made in the same situation); </li>
                    <li>Graphic texts (e.g., relate information from graphic texts to their own pur- poses for reading and/or to information from other sources – for example, by using a road map to help plan a trip);</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>demonstrate understanding of a variety of informational, narrative, and graphic texts commonly read in daily life (e.g., recipes, manuals, instructions, invoices, e-mails, encyclopedia entries, pamphlets, news reports, short stories, train schedules, bar graphs) by using and/or responding to them appropriately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4> Using Strategies to Understand New Words and Expressions and to Build Vocabulary</h4>
        <ol>    
            <li>use appropriate strategies to discover the meaning of unfamiliar and technical words encountered in their reading (e.g., use print, online, and bilingual dictionaries; use context to determine the meaning of new words; create concept maps using new words; build a bank of sight words to increase reading ﬂuency);</li>
            <li>use appropriate strategies to discover the meaning of unfamiliar idiomatic expressions encountered in their reading (e.g.,“read past” an unfamiliar expression to gain a sense of the sentence, then make a guess as to its meaning; use or create dictionaries of phrases and expressions);</li>
            <li>use appropriate strategies to expand their vocabulary through reading (e.g., use knowledge of roots, preﬁxes, and suffixes to create new words; contribute to class word walls; create personal dictionaries of new words encountered in their reading).</li>
