  <h2>ENG4U, English Grade 12 – University Preparation</h2>

  <h3>Welcome to ENG4U!</h3>
  <p>
    This course is designed to develop students’ critical thinking, reading, writing, and communication skills at an advanced level.
    Throughout the course, students will engage with a variety of literary, informational, and media texts, including novels, plays,
    poetry, essays, and digital media. Through close reading and analytical writing, students will deepen their understanding of
    complex ideas, explore multiple perspectives, and refine their ability to express themselves clearly and effectively in both
    academic and creative contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Students will also develop research and inquiry skills, preparing them for the rigour and expectations of post-secondary education.
    Emphasis is placed on reading and writing with purpose and precision, using evidence to support arguments, and crafting essays,
    presentations, and responses that reflect independent and thoughtful engagement with texts and issues.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> ENG3U (English, Grade 11, University Preparation), as specified by the Ontario Ministry of Education</p>

  <p>
    This course was made with the student in mind. I wanted to create a course that encourages reflection, independence,
    and depth of thought. English is not about having the “right” answer—it's about exploring ideas, questioning assumptions,
    and expressing yourself with clarity and confidence. A successful ENG4U student is one who takes risks, embraces feedback,
    and commits to personal and academic growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    I assume that most or all students taking this course will be preparing for university, so think of this course as practice
    for that next step. Please read instructions carefully, reflect on your learning regularly, and aim to make each assignment
    better than the last. There is always room to grow—so be thoughtful, be creative, and challenge yourself. Your effort will be recognized.
