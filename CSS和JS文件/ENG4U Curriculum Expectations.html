          <strong>1.5 Critical Literacy</strong>
          <p>Identify and analyse the perspectives and/or biases evident in texts, including complex and challenging texts, commenting with understanding and increasing insight on any questions they may raise about beliefs, values, identity, and power (e.g., debate the implicit assumption in an anti-smoking campaign that it is acceptable to limit some individual freedoms to achieve a collective social benefit; determine whether and how mainstream media coverage of a war or conflict manufactures consent or creates support for the war effort)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompts: 
              "How does a broadcast of a national political convention reflect the values, beliefs, and perspectives of its creators, and to what purpose?"<br>
              "In what ways might one TV channel’s [or newspaper’s] coverage of an election campaign differ from another’s?"<br>
              "What perspectives were omitted in this televised discussion of contemporary social issues?"

      <li>
          <strong>1.6 Production Perspectives</strong>
          <p>Explain, with increasing understanding and insight, how production, marketing, financing, distribution, and legal/regulatory factors influence the media industry (e.g., in a small group, chart the costs of a thirty-second ad on prime-time television, a full-page ad in a daily newspaper, a thirty-second ad on a local radio station, and a full-page ad in a community newspaper, and explain why the costs of the advertisements vary so dramatically)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompts: 
              "How might owning a radio station, a television station, and a magazine help a film company promote its newest feature film?"<br>
              "What are the implications of having the soft-drink vending machines in schools controlled by a single soft-drink company?"

  <h4>2. Understanding Media Forms, Conventions, and Techniques</h4>
  <ol>
      <!-- 2.1 -->
      <li>
          <strong>2.1 Form</strong>
          <p>Identify general and specific characteristics of a variety of media forms and demonstrate insight into the way they shape content and create meaning (e.g., explain how the format and presentation of news items on television can create a culture of fear; explain why film adaptations of novels often differ significantly from the novels they are based on, and describe the nature of the differences in a specific example)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompt: "What might you experience differently in viewing an event on television rather than &lsquo;live&rsquo; on site, or vice versa?"
          </blockquote>
      </li>

      <!-- 2.2 -->
      <li>
          <strong>2.2 Conventions and Techniques</strong>
          <p>Identify conventions and/or techniques used in a variety of media forms and demonstrate insight into the way they convey meaning and influence their audience (e.g., reality television shows use editing and the careful manipulation of setting and costume to conceal the extent to which they are controlled by the producer; TV news coverage intersperses reporter narration with brief speech clips from protagonists to add interest and authenticity)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompt: "List some conventions that are used in many video games and explain how they shape the way the games are played."
          </blockquote>

  <!-- Creating Media Texts -->
  <h4>3. Creating Media Texts</h4>

      <!-- 3.1 -->
      <li>
          <strong>3.1 Purpose and Audience</strong>
          <p>Describe the topic, purpose, and audience for media texts they plan to create (e.g., a storyboard for a short videotaped editorial on a current issue or topic aimed at an adult audience; a multimedia presentation for peers on an environmental issue) and identify practical, interpretive, and/or creative challenges they may face in achieving their purpose</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompt: "What are some interpretive or creative challenges you might face in promoting the benefits of free speech to a diverse community?"
          </blockquote>
      </li>

      <!-- 3.2 -->
      <li>
          <strong>3.2 Form</strong>
          <p>Select the media form best suited to the topic, purpose, and audience for a media text they plan to create, and explain why it is the most appropriate choice (e.g., explain why a multimedia presentation would be the most effective way to convince shareholders that a multinational corporation should improve its child labour practices; explain why a pamphlet would be the most effective way to lobby for a particular program to help poor people)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompt: "What media form would be the most effective way to interest a Grade 9 class in reading a short story you enjoyed?"
          </blockquote>
      </li>

      <!-- 3.3 -->
      <li>
          <strong>3.3 Conventions and Techniques</strong>
          <p>Identify a variety of conventions and/or techniques appropriate to a media form they plan to use, and explain why these will help communicate a specific aspect of their intended meaning most effectively (e.g., conventions/techniques for a storyboard for a videotaped editorial on a current issue: an outline of types of shots, camera angles, sound effects, dialogue, and transitions between shots to be used, including brief notes about how each will contribute to the overall message; conventions/techniques for a multimedia presentation for peers to promote environmental awareness: an outline of images, text, and sound effects to be used, including brief notes about how each will contribute to the overall message)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompts: 
              "Why do you think fast-food restaurants use pictures of selected menu items as well as printed listings on their menu board?"<br>
              "What criteria would you use to determine the shots in your videotaped editorial? How might the order of the shots help you convey your message more effectively?"
          </blockquote>
      </li>

      <!-- 3.4 -->
      <li>
          <strong>3.4 Producing Media Texts</strong>
          <p>Produce media texts, including complex texts, for a variety of purposes and audiences, using the most appropriate forms, conventions, and techniques (e.g., a reading promotion campaign to support personal reading or a school-wide sustained silent reading program, using a variety of media forms, including posters in the library, computer presentations at an assembly, and a special &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; during morning announcements; a commercial to raise awareness about Aboriginal rights)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompt: "What kind of content would you need to include in a travel magazine to attract particular types of advertisers?"
          </blockquote>
      </li>

  <h4>4. Reflecting on Skills and Strategies</h4>
  <ol>
      <!-- 4.1 -->
      <li>
          <strong>4.1 Metacognition</strong>
          <p>Demonstrate insight into their strengths and weaknesses as media interpreters and producers, and practise the strategies they found most helpful when interpreting and creating particularly complex media texts to improve their skills (e.g., use feedback from the target audience for a media text they produced to evaluate its success; use feedback from peers to help identify their personal strengths as media creators and strategies that might help them improve)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompt: &ldquo;How could analysing the appeal of a controversial television show help you in creating your own show?&rdquo;
          </blockquote>
      </li>

      <!-- 4.2 -->
      <li>
          <strong>4.2 Interconnected Skills</strong>
          <p>Explain how their skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing help them interpret and produce media texts (e.g., the ability to identify words that indicate bias in written material can help them detect bias when interpreting media messages)</p>
          <blockquote>
              Teacher prompt: &ldquo;How could participation in a classroom dialogue about bias help you identify bias in media texts?&rdquo;
