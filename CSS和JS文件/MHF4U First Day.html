  <h2>MHF4U, Advanced Functions</h2>

  <!-- 简要介绍 -->
  <p><strong>Welcome to MHF4U!</strong></p>
  <p>
    This course extends students’ experience with functions and their applications. Students will explore the properties and transformations of polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions, and will develop techniques for combining functions, solving equations, and analyzing function models in real-world contexts. Students will refine the mathematical processes necessary for success in senior mathematics and for related fields at the post-secondary level.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the end of the course, students will be able to recognize connections between different mathematical representations, enhance their problem-solving strategies, and appreciate the power of mathematics in describing the world around us.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> MCR3U (Functions) or MCF3M (Functions and Applications), as specified by the Ontario Ministry of Education</p>

  <!-- 课程理念 -->
  <p>
    This course was made with the student in mind. I wanted to create a course that would require more
    <em>thinking and less memorization</em>. Mathematics, and especially the study of advanced functions,
    is built on logical reasoning and pattern recognition—being able to
    <strong>think critically</strong> is what makes a successful advanced functions student.
    I assume that most or all students taking this course will be attending university or post-secondary
    institutions, so as practice for those next steps, please ensure you are carefully reading
    all instructions and welcoming any feedback offered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Spend as much time as possible on each section of the course, using as many of your own ideas and
    problem-solving approaches as you can. There are always ways to improve your grade, so take a chance,
    think more, and fear less. You will be rewarded.
