  <h2>Understanding Assessment For, As, and Of Learning in the OSSD</h2>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The Ontario Ministry of Education emphasizes a balanced approach to assessment that supports and improves student learning. Within the framework of the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD), three distinct but interrelated types of assessment are used: <strong>Assessment for Learning</strong>, <strong>Assessment as Learning</strong>, and <strong>Assessment of Learning</strong>. These assessment types are central to effective teaching and are outlined in the Ministry document <em>Growing Success (2010)</em>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>1. Assessment <em>For</em> Learning (AfL)</h3>
  
  <h4>Definition</h4>
  <p>
    Assessment for Learning is <strong>formative assessment</strong>. It occurs <strong>before and during the learning process</strong>, and its primary purpose is to inform instruction by providing feedback that helps students improve.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Purpose</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To determine students’ prior knowledge and skill levels.</li>
    <li>To diagnose learning needs and misconceptions.</li>
    <li>To guide instructional planning and differentiation.</li>
    <li>To provide ongoing feedback to help students improve.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Characteristics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducted throughout the learning process.</li>
    <li>Focuses on learning goals and success criteria.</li>
    <li>Involves descriptive feedback, not just marks.</li>
    <li>Includes quizzes, drafts, observations, peer assessments, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Teacher’s Role</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Clarify learning intentions and success criteria.</li>
    <li>Adjust instruction based on assessment data.</li>
    <li>Provide timely, specific feedback.</li>
    <li>Encourage student reflection and goal setting.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>2. Assessment <em>As</em> Learning (AaL)</h3>
  
  <h4>Definition</h4>
  <p>
    Assessment as Learning emphasizes the <strong>student’s role</strong> in the learning process. Students <strong>actively monitor and reflect on their own learning</strong>, becoming self-directed learners.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Purpose</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To develop students’ metacognitive skills.</li>
    <li>To promote responsibility and ownership of learning.</li>
    <li>To help students identify their strengths and areas for growth.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Characteristics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Student-centered and reflective.</li>
    <li>Involves goal setting, self-assessment, peer feedback.</li>
    <li>Encourages self-monitoring and strategy adjustment.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Teacher’s Role</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Teach students how to self-assess and give peer feedback.</li>
    <li>Provide tools for reflection (e.g., journals, checklists).</li>
    <li>Model how to use feedback effectively.</li>
    <li>Support students in setting and reviewing learning goals.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3. Assessment <em>Of</em> Learning (AoL)</h3>
  
  <h4>Definition</h4>
  <p>
    Assessment of Learning is <strong>summative assessment</strong>. It takes place <strong>at the end of the learning cycle</strong> and is used to determine achievement levels and assign grades.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Purpose</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>To evaluate and certify student achievement.</li>
    <li>To report grades to students, families, and schools.</li>
    <li>To inform decisions about credit granting and progress.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Characteristics</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Formal and structured.</li>
    <li>Results in grades or marks.</li>
    <li>Includes tests, final projects, performance tasks, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Teacher’s Role</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure assessments are valid and aligned with expectations.</li>
    <li>Use professional judgment to assign grades.</li>
    <li>Gather evidence from observations, conversations, and products.</li>
    <li>Communicate results clearly and fairly.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Integrating the Three Types of Assessment</h3>
  <p>Each assessment type serves a unique purpose, and all three should be used in combination for effective teaching and learning:</p>
  
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Aspect</th>
        <th>Assessment For Learning</th>
        <th>Assessment As Learning</th>
        <th>Assessment Of Learning</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Timing</strong></td>
        <td>Ongoing, during learning</td>
        <td>Ongoing, during learning</td>
        <td>End of learning cycle</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Focus</strong></td>
        <td>Diagnosing and guiding instruction</td>
        <td>Developing self-monitoring and reflection</td>
        <td>Evaluating final achievement</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Student Role</strong></td>
        <td>Receiver of feedback</td>
        <td>Active participant in learning</td>
        <td>Demonstrator of achievement</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Feedback</strong></td>
        <td>Descriptive and ongoing</td>
        <td>Reflective and growth-oriented</td>
        <td>Summative and evaluative</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The integration of Assessment for, as, and of Learning ensures a comprehensive, student-centered approach to assessment under the OSSD framework. When used together, they support academic success, promote self-awareness, and empower students to take ownership of their learning journey.
