<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Haria, a poor barber lived alone in his small hut. He was dedicated to his work. And whatever he earns was enough to fulfill his needs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One evening, after returning from work, Haria was hungry. “What shall I cook tonight?" he thought. Just then he heard a hen clucking outside his hut. “That hen would make a great feast for me," thought Haria and prepared to catch the hen.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a little effort he was able to catch the hen. As he was about to kill the hen, it squeaked, “Please do not kill me, O kind man! I will help you." Haria stopped. Though he was surprised that the hen spoke, he asked, “How can you help me?"</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“If you spare my life, I will lay a golden egg everyday for you," said the hen. Haria’s eyes got widened in delight. Haria was surprised to hear this promise. “A golden egg! That too everyday! But why should I believe you? You might be lying," said Haria. “If I do not lay a golden egg tomorrow, you can kill me," said the hen. After this promise, Haria spared the hen and waited for the next day.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The next morning, Haria found a golden egg lying outside his hut and the hen sitting beside it. “It is true! You really can lay a golden egg!" exclaimed Haria with great delight. He did not reveal this incident to any one, fearing that others would catch the hen.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">From that day onwards, the hen would lay a golden egg everyday. In return, Haria took good care of the hen. Very soon, Haria became rich.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But he became greedy. He thought, “If I cut open the hen’s stomach, I can get out all the golden eggs at once. I do not have to wait for the hen to lay the golden eggs one by one."</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">That night, he brought the hen to the interior portion of his house and killed the hen. But to his dismay, he found no golden eggs. Not even one.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“What have I done? My greed had made me kill the hen," he wailed. But it was too late.</span></p>
