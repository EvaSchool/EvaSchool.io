<h2 class="card-title">1. Response bias</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>when respondents change their answers to influence the results, to avoid embarrassment, or to give the answer they think the questioner wants.</p>
<p>Example:<br>A teacher asks students to raise their hand if they cheated on last week’s test. Students will not want to admit to cheating on a test so it is unlikely that many will raise their hand.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">2. Sampling bias</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>when the sample does not closely represent the population.</p>
<p>Example:<br>A politician goes back to the farming community she grew up in to ask for opinions on her latest initiative for the agriculture industry. It is likely that a larger proportion of the people she speaks to would support the initiative, both because it would benefit them and because she grew up in the area. This would not accurately represent the entire population.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">3. Measurement bias</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>when the collection method is such that the characteristics are consistently over- or under-represented.</p>
<p>Example:<br>A survey question asks, “A lot of people do not like math. How would you feel being referred to as a math geek?” This is a leading question; the wording of the question can affect the outcome by influencing someone’s answer. Other types of measurement bias can occur when the collection method affects the results, for example when the options in a multiple-choice question are too limited for an honest response.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">4. &nbsp;Non‐response bias</h2>
</div>
<div class="collapse">
<div class="card-body">
<p>when the opinions of respondents differ in meaningful ways from those of non-respondents.</p>
<p>Example:<br>A mail-in survey asked respondents about their drinking habits. Only 3% of the surveys were returned. Such a small return rate would likely not yield a representative sample. In fact, those who respond often have very strong opinions about the subject matter and so the results could easily over- or under-estimate the feelings of the population.</p>

<h2>Identifying Bias</h2>
<p>A large sample does not guarantee good data. This is especially true if the method of data collection has some bias associated with it. Identify the type of bias that may occur in each situation.</p>
<p>a) Families in a neighborhood are told they are part of a study about healthy eating habits.<br>b) You ask only students on sports teams how to spend the school fundraising money.<br>c) A survey question asks, “Who is the best basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan or LeBron James?”<br>d) A radio call-in show asks callers to answer the question, “Are you in favor of a law that would ban pit bulls from the city?”</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>a) This is response bias. Because the families are told the study is looking at healthy eating habits, it is likely they will start eating better because they are being watched and want to give a good impression.</p>
<p>b) Since you are only asking students who play sports, it is likely the respondents will overwhelmingly want to spend the money on sports-related things. This is sampling bias.</p>
<p>c) This is measurement bias because there are only two choices.</p>
<p>d) Usually, the people who call into radio shows have extreme opinions. People who are indifferent or do not think the topic is important may not vote, so a large proportion of listeners choose not to respond. This is non-response bias. Also, since only listeners of the radio show will call in, it is also sampling bias since the respondents likely would not<br>properly represent the population.</p>
