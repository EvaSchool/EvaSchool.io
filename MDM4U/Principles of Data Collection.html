<p><strong>C</strong>. A chain store is trying to decide whether to open a store in Huntsville, Ontario. The company decided to survey 25% of the population of Huntsville and three nearby towns. The table shows the population of each location.</p>

<p>If 25% of each town is sampled, this is a stratified sample since the number from&nbsp;each town in the sample would be in the same proportion as in the population&nbsp;(the company would survey 4764 people from Huntsville, 210 from Kearney,&nbsp;579 from Emsdale, and 195 from McMurrich). Everyone has an equal opportunity&nbsp;to be selected since the 25% of people being sampled are randomly selected from each town.</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>. A market research company mails surveys to all of the adult residents in a town. The survey asks about brands of consumer products. The residents are asked to mail back their responses in a prepaid envelope.</p>

</td>

<div class="collapse">
<p>Since the residents choose whether or not they respond to the survey, it is a voluntary response survey. Even though all residents received the survey, the data will reflect responses only from those who are interested. Usually, only people who feel strongly one way or another will respond. Thus, the entire population will not be represented in the sample.</p>

<p>Since the reporter surveys anyone who is walking on the street, the data are collected in a way that is easily accessible. So, this is a convenience sample. The entire population is not represented since only people in that area at that time are surveyed.</p>

<p><strong>F</strong>. Researchers want to investigate the use of pesticides by apple farmers&nbsp;in Ontario. They divide the province into 10 sections and choose five sections at random. They sample all farms within the five sections.</p>
<p class="btn btn-primary btn-reveal">Continue Learning</p>
</td>
<td>
<div class="collapse">
<p>This is a cluster sample because the population is divided into groups, a number of sections are randomly chosen, and all farms in those sections are surveyed. Since there is random selection in the first set of groups and sections, all groups and sections are equally likely to be chosen. It is more efficient for the researchers to visit the farms within five areas than it would be to travel to different farms throughout the whole province.</p>

<p><b>G. The</b> province wants to randomly choose 250 students. It randomly selects five school boards from the 72 in Ontario. Then it randomly selects five schools in each of those boards. Finally, it randomly chooses 50 students in each of those schools.</p>
