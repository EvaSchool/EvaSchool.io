<h2>WHAT IS CORRELATION?</h2>
<p>Correlation is a term in statistics that refers to the degree of association between two random variables. So the correlation between two data sets is the amount to which they resemble one another.<br>If A and B tend to be observed at the same time, you’re pointing out a correlation between A and B. You’re not implying A causes B or vice versa. You’re simply saying when A is observed, B is observed. They move together or show up at the same time.</p>

<h4 class="small"><span style="color: rgb(6, 33, 120);">3 types of Correlations:</span></h4>
<ol class="large-number">
<li>A positive correlation is when you observe A increasing and B increasing as well. Or if A decreases, B correspondingly decreases. Example: the more purchases made in your app, the more time is spent using your app.</li>
<li>A negative correlation is when an increase in A leads to a decrease in B or vice versa.</li>
<li>No correlation is when two variables are completely unrelated and a change in A leads to no changes in B, or vice versa.</li>

<h2>WHAT IS CAUSATION?</h2>
<p>Causation implies that A and B have a cause-and-effect relationship with one another. You’re saying A causes B.</p>
<p><br>Causation is also known as causality.</p>
<p>1. Causation means that two events appear at the same time or one after the other.</p>
<p>2. It means these two variables not only appear together, but the existence of one causes the other to manifest.</p>

<p>The presumed relationship can exist when it seems to make sense that two variables are related, and yet no causality can be inferred and it is also difficult to identify a clear common cause factor. An example of this would be a positive correlation between the number of books in children’s homes and their math scores.</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane fade">
<p>A reverse cause-and-effect relationship occurs when the assumed causation becomes reversed. Consider the positive correlation between severe illness and depression. A researcher might hypothesize that being severely ill is very emotionally difficult and so it causes depression. However, in reality, depressed people struggle to take care of themselves, so they are more likely to become severely ill.</p>

<p><strong>Suggest the most likely type of relationship for each correlation.</strong></p>
<p>a) The number of fire stations in a city is positively correlated with the number of parks.<br>b) The price of butter is positively correlated with fish population levels.<br>c) Seat belt infractions are positively correlated with traffic fatalities.<br>d) Self-esteem is positively correlated with vocabulary level.<br>e) Charged crimes are positively correlated with the size of the police force.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>a) It does not seem to make sense that building more fire stations would cause an increase in the number of parks in a city. Both of these variables likely share a positive correlation with the city population. This is most likely a common-cause relationship.</p>
<p>b) No clear connection exists between the price of butter and the fish population. When two variables share a strong linear correlation for no logical reason at all, it is an accidental relationship.</p>
<p>c) Seat belts are specifically designed to save lives in the event of an accident. A strong case can be made that this is a cause-and-effect relationship.</p>
<p>d) It makes sense that someone with strong language skills would tend to also have higher self-esteem. It would be difficult to suggest, however, that one causes the other, and it would also be challenging to identify a clear common cause factor. This is most likely a presumed relationship.</p>
<p>e) One hypothesis might be that when crimes increase, a police department responds by recruiting more officers. It could also be argued that as the police force increases, there are more opportunities to catch and charge criminals. A reverse cause-and-effect relationship occurs when the assumed causation becomes reversed.</p>
