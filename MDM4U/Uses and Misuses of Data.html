<h4>Flawed Research</h4>
<p>If a piece of research has not been designed or carried out in a professional and ethical manner then this will impact on the quality of the findings. Understanding the principles in research design and delivery will help you assess research findings. Here are some questions you should ask, although not all will be relevant in every case.</p>
<p>Are the research aims properly explained?<br>Is the methodology clearly set out?<br>Is the literature review relevant and up to date?<br>Is there information on sample sizes and how they were selected?<br>Is there information on response rates?<br>Was there checking of the accuracy of data returns?<br>Is there adequate information about how data was processed?<br>Is there a rationale given for the analysis methods and statistical tests chosen?<br>Are the conclusions and interpretations justified by the evidence?</p>

<h4>Use Findings out of context</h4>
<p>This is a particular hazard in the social care arena, especially for research into the effectiveness of particular projects or schemes. For example, a scheme to provide support and advice for lone mothers was extremely successful and produced measurable changes in the quality of life for the women involved across a range of social, personal, and economic measures. However, it does not follow that this scheme could be replicated equally successfully in other towns by other staff with other groups of lone mothers. What is needed is for the research to identify as accurately as possible the factors that enabled success and those that hindered it. Some useful questions to help establish this might look at the success of the project in different ways, for instance:</p>
<p>Was it about how the work was planned and the consultation processes involved?<br>Was it about charismatic leadership and/or committed workers?<br>Was it about a particular group of lone mothers who responded in a certain way?<br>Was it the location or the premises, the building itself - or both?<br>What other factors were at work?</p>

<h4>Stretching Findings</h4>
<p>This is the opposite of ignoring important research. Researchers can produce cautiously optimistic or positive results that are then 'stretched' or 'talked up' to give them a significance that is not warranted by the evidence. This can happen for a variety of reasons, not all intentional. Research commissioners may be looking for definitive results or findings that lean towards a particular set of outcomes and as a result place pressure on researchers to highlight these rather than other more important results. If a researcher has an insider stance there may be an inevitable bias in the analysis or presentation of findings. Commercial research organizations may be conscious of their interest in obtaining future contracts and this may inform reporting. It can also happen through indifference to or ignorance of professional standards.</p>

<p>Campaigning groups have often used simple statistics like the number of children living in poverty to summarize issues in a powerful way. Such use is perfectly legitimate and valuable in forcing through important issues of social policy, however, the truth is usually more complex than simple statistics suggest and it is essential to maintain a critical perspective when statistics are presented to support a viewpoint.</p>

<h2>Rejecting or Ignoring Findings</h2>
<p>A common technique, much beloved by researchers themselves, is to undermine or reject research studies by the deployment of contradictory findings. This is often a legitimate and necessary activity that properly tests and critiques research. However, it can also reflect academic nit-picking or battles between entrenched theoretical perspectives that prevent useful research from being used to effect action or social policy. For practitioners, it is the problem of balancing complex realities against the necessity of making decisions in the real world.</p>
<p>Another systematic and well-established technique for dealing with research is to just pretend it isn't there.</p>
