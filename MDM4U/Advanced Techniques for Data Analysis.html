<h1>Advanced Techniques for Data Analysis</h1>

<p>Data Analysis</p>
<footer>Data analysis is the new emerging way of find out statistical patterns and relevant information by using data analysis. Data Analysis contains a set of processes like Data Modelling, Data Integration process, Data processing, and Data Evaluation etc. By using data Analysis, you can easily divide a big number of data sets into a small piece of statistical patterns, later you can feed them in the database easily.</footer></blockquote>

<h4>Why Data Analysis?</h4>
<p>We live in a digital era where data converts in a Nanosecond that is much faster than a normal human capability. In the corporate sector, employees work on a large volume of data which is extracted from different sources like Social Network, Media, Newspaper, Book, cloud media storage etc. But sometimes it may create some difficulties for you to summarize the data. Sometimes when you fetch the data from other sources, you cannot predict that how much data will be stored in the database.</p>
<p>As a result, the data set becomes more difficult and takes enough time for analyzing the process. So, let’s explain the solution to this problem. Try to fetch data sets in the form of a new category and retrieve the data type whatever data type you want for data filtration. Data Analysis technique provides the good amount of data quality. Excel is the best tool for data Analysis process. Data Analysis is much useful in Corporate Analysis, Data management, Market Analysis, Risk Management, and Fraud Detection.</p>

<h4>Benefits of Data Analysis</h4>
<p>Data Analysis attributes can easily find the missing patterns from the inconsistent data that increases the optimization speed of the optimal result.<br>If you work in a consistent way until the deployment of the business objectives that increase the brand loyalty that will really help you in marketing campaigns. The benefit is that customers can directly communicate with the organization to serve better.<br>By the completion of project delivery to the stakeholders/customers, that surely increases the trust in your organization and the work that you delivered.

<div class="collapse">
<p>Classification analysis is used to find relevant and important information on the metadata and data sets. This analysis is used to retrieve the different types of data in different class objects. Classification is just like clustering which segments data format into different segments called object classes. Unlike classification, data analysts contain data for different clusters or classes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excel is the most powerful feature of data analytics that is used to determine the data in terms of Insertion of the data, data computation, modification of the data, and deletion of the data. It is a most sophisticated data analysis tool. Excel provides a way to solve big data in a wide variety of formats like VBA, Macro, Function, and Pivot filters.</p>

<div class="collapse">
<p>A pivot table is a key program feature that allows data to summarize &amp; reorganize selected multiple rows and columns in a database table or spreadsheet to get the desired report. It is a mainframe of an Excel database. Hence, a pivot table can solve a large amount of data set in one Excel sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SQL is known as Standard Query Language. Although, SQL is not a language but a framework or tool that is used to solve millions of data in a quick manner by using its features. SQL is totally dependent on tables and their functions. It provides data addition, insertion, deletion, etc. It contains four commands DML (Data Manipulation Language), DDL (Data Definition Language), DCL (Data Control Language), and TCL (Transaction Control Language).</p>

<p>Regression Analysis</p>
<p class="btn btn-primary btn-reveal">Continue Learning</p>
</td>

<div class="collapse">
<p>This type of analysis is used to define predictive modeling that further evaluates the relationship between an independent variable that is defined as a predictor and a dependent result. This technique is mainly used for time series data modeling, forecasting, and finding the effect of the data variables. Understand with an example, a relationship between road accidents and fast rash driving is the best example through regression. Regression analysis is a very useful tool for analyzing data and data modeling.</p>
